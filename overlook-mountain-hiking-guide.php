    <!-- SECTION 1: ACCESSIBILITY FROM NYC -->
    <section id="accessibility">
        <h2>Getting to Overlook Mountain from NYC</h2>
        <p>Overlook Mountain is further north than lower Hudson Valley trails but remains accessible for day trips. Woodstock's charm makes it a destination hike worth the extra distance.</p>

        <h3>üöó Driving from NYC</h3>
        <p><strong>Distance:</strong> 90 miles | <strong>Drive Time:</strong> 2-2.5 hours from Manhattan</p>
        <p>Take Henry Hudson Parkway to Palisades Interstate Parkway north, then Route 9W to Route 23 east toward Windham. Exit at Woodstock and follow trailhead signs. Parking available at Overlook Mountain House parking area ($10-15 for day-use).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Google Maps: "Overlook Mountain Woodstock NY"</li>
            <li>Peak season parking fills by 9am on weekends</li>
            <li>Overflow parking available in Woodstock village (pay lots)</li>
            <li>Weekday parking: abundant and free</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>üöå Shuttle Services from NYC</h3>
        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2.5-3 hours | <strong>Cost:</strong> $25-40 roundtrip</p>
        <p>Several hiking tour companies offer group shuttles from NYC to Overlook Mountain Saturdays and Sundays. Book online in advance. Advantages: no driving stress, guides provide local knowledge, built-in social experience.</p>

        <h3>Woodstock Village as Base</h3>
        <p>Consider staying overnight in Woodstock. The artistic village offers excellent restaurants, accommodations, and cultural attractions. Hiking as part of a weekend trip provides better tick prevention through less rushed planning.</p>

        <h3>Tick Prevention During Travel</h3>
        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Critical Tip:</strong> Change into complete permethrin-treated hiking outfit AT the parking lot, not before driving. Overlook's long drive from NYC means you'll be sitting in treated clothing for 2+ hours. Change after arrival to keep gear fresh.
        </div>

    <!-- SECTION 2: TRAIL DIFFICULTY & SKILLS -->
    <section id="difficulty">
        <h2>Trail Difficulty & Route Options</h2>
        <p>Overlook offers multiple route options from easy valley walks to challenging ridge traverses.</p>

        <h3>Easy Valley Walk (2 miles, 1 hour)</h3>
        <p>Walk from parking lot through Overlook Mountain House ruins to tower base without summit climb. Forest walking, minimal elevation gain. See historic architecture and enjoy scenery without peak effort.</p>

        <h3>Moderate Summit Hike (5 miles, 2.5-3 hours)</h3>
        <p>Standard route combining red-blazed trail to summit tower. Sustained moderate climb through mixed hardwood and evergreen forest. Fire tower ascent provides exhilarating 360-degree views. Elevation gain: 1,500 feet. Recommended for fit recreational hikers. Tick risk: High (dense forest habitat).</p>

        <h3>Challenging Ridge Loop (8+ miles, 4-5 hours)</h3>
        <p>Extended circuit including multiple peaks (North Point, South Point) and scenic ridge sections. Technical scrambling, significant elevation changes. For experienced hikers comfortable with exposure. Tick risk: Very High (diverse habitat).</p>

        <div class="strategy-box">
            <strong>Recommended Route:</strong> The moderate summit hike is the classic Overlook experience. First-timers should start here. Fire tower experience is worth the climbing effort.

    <!-- SECTION 3: SEASONAL WEATHER & CONDITIONS -->
    <section id="weather">
        <h2>Seasonal Weather Patterns & Hiking Conditions</h2>

        <h3>Spring (April-May): Muddy & Wet üå∏</h3>
        <p><strong>Temperature:</strong> 40-55¬∞F | <strong>Tick Risk:</strong> Moderate</p>
        <p>Heavy mud from snowmelt creates slippery climbing sections. Wet forest provides optimal tick habitat. Nymph ticks emerge by late April. Wait until late May for better conditions unless you don't mind mud.</p>

        <h3>Summer (June-August): Crowded & Buggy ‚òÄÔ∏è</h3>
        <p><strong>Temperature:</strong> 70-80¬∞F | <strong>Tick Risk:</strong> Very High</p>
        <p>Peak tourist season with crowds on weekends. Peak tick season‚Äînymphs extremely active. Afternoon thunderstorms develop quickly at high elevation. Start by 8am. Plan for afternoon descent before storms arrive.</p>

        <h3>Fall (September-November): Prime Season üçÇ</h3>
        <p><strong>Temperature:</strong> 50-65¬∞F | <strong>Tick Risk:</strong> High</p>
        <p>Exceptional conditions with fall foliage backdrops and clear views from summit. September offers best tick-to-weather ratio. October brings adult tick emergence. November features fewer people and reduced tick populations.</p>

        <h3>Winter (December-March): Challenging ‚ùÑÔ∏è</h3>
        <p><strong>Temperature:</strong> 20-40¬∞F | <strong>Tick Risk:</strong> Low</p>
        <p>Snow and ice create serious technical hazards. Fire tower becomes treacherous with icing. Microspikes essential. Consider snowshoes above 3,000 feet. Only recommended for experienced winter hikers.</p>

        <div class="warning">
            <strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Elevation Hazards:</strong> Overlook's high elevation means weather can be dramatically different than valley. 30-degree temperature drop from base to summit is common. Bring windproof layer regardless of forecast.
        </div>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 4: TICK PREVENTION STRATEGY -->
    <section id="tick-prevention">
        <h2>Overlook Mountain Tick Prevention Strategy</h2>
        <p>Overlook's elevation and diverse habitats create complex tick exposure. Comprehensive prevention is essential despite apparent summit safety (ticks thrive at higher elevations in Catskills).</p>

        <h3>Pre-Hike Preparation</h3>
        <div class="strategy-box">
            <ul>
                <li>Long pants tucked into treated white socks (for visibility)</li>
                <li>Long-sleeve treated shirt</li>
                <li>Hat or hood to protect hairline</li>
                <li>Picarikin repellent applied to wrists, ankles, neck</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Mid-Hike Tick Checks</h3>
        <p>Perform visual inspections at the 2-mile mark (tower base) and summit. Look for dark specks crawling on white socks or clothing. If ticks are found crawling, remove them immediately using removal tool.</p>

        <h3>Post-Hike Protocol</h3>
        <p>Shower within 2 hours of returning home. Inspect hairline, behind ears, armpits, groin, and between toes. Wash treated clothing separately on high heat (140¬∞F+). Dry on high heat setting.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Overlook-Specific Risk:</strong> The red-blazed trail passes through dense hemlock groves from miles 1-3‚Äîprime tick microhabitat. Despite comfortable temperatures, maintain full protective gear. Don't underestimate low-visibility forest sections.

    <!-- SECTION 6: DETAILED ROUTE GUIDE -->
    <section id="route-details">
        <h2>Detailed Route Guide: Standard Summit Route</h2>

        <h3>Route Summary: 5 Miles, 2.5-3 Hours, 1,500ft Elevation Gain</h3>
        <p><strong>Start:</strong> Overlook Mountain House parking area (red-blazed trail)</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>0.0-0.3 mi:</strong> Overlook Mountain House ruins (historic building, interesting architecture)</li>
            <li><strong>0.3-2.0 mi:</strong> Red-blazed trail through hemlock grove (steady sustained climb, muddy sections possible)</li>
            <li><strong>2.0-2.5 mi:</strong> Final push to fire tower (steep technical section, elevation gain accelerates)</li>
            <li><strong>2.5+ mi:</strong> Summit tower (climb stairs for 360-degree views, extreme altitude sensation)</li>
            <li><strong>5.0 mi:</strong> Return via same route (faster descent)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Fire Tower Experience</h3>
        <p>The restored 1930s fire tower is the highlight of Overlook Mountain. Climbing the tower's stairs provides exhilarating 360-degree views of the Catskills, Hudson Valley, and on clear days, the Berkshires. The tower is weather-dependent‚Äîdon't climb during thunderstorms or high winds.</p>

        <h3>Best Times to Hike</h3>
        <p>Weekday mornings (8-10am) in September offer optimal conditions: fewer crowds, comfortable temperatures, excellent visibility, and moderate tick pressure. Avoid weekends June-August when 500+ people hike the trail daily.</p>

        <h3>Water & Supplies</h3>
        <p>No water sources on the trail. Carry 4+ liters minimum for 1,500ft elevation gain and 5-mile distance. Bring substantial lunch and energy snacks. Woodstock village has excellent restaurants if you prefer eating at base.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 7: SAFETY & EMERGENCY -->
    <section id="safety">
        <h2>Safety Considerations & Emergency Information</h2>

        <h3>Cell Service</h3>
        <p>Verizon has excellent coverage at summit. AT&T spotty in forest sections. Always tell someone your planned route and expected return time.</p>

        <h3>Hazards to Be Aware Of</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fire tower heights:</strong> 40ft+ stairs with open railings‚Äînot for people with height fear</li>
            <li><strong>Muddy sections:</strong> Spring mud and rain-soaked trails create slipping hazards on climbs</li>
            <li><strong>Ticks:</strong> Primary hazard. Dense forest and high elevation support robust populations</li>
            <li><strong>Weather:</strong> Rapid changes at elevation‚Äîsummit can be 20-30 degrees colder than base</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Nearest Hospital</h3>
        <p><strong>Woodstock Hospital / UC Health:</strong> 10 minutes from parking. Full emergency care and Lyme disease testing available. Mention tick exposure if symptoms develop after hiking.</p>

    <!-- SECTION 8: SUMMARY -->
    <section id="summary">
        <h2>Overlook Mountain: Gateway to Catskills Adventure</h2>
        <p>Overlook Mountain provides the classic Catskills experience: significant elevation challenge, historic fire tower, spectacular 360-degree views, and accessible distance from NYC. The moderate 5-mile summit hike offers authentic mountain adventure for recreational hikers.</p>
