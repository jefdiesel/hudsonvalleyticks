    <h2>The Case for Bulk Permethrin</h2>

    <p>Most outdoor enthusiasts start with small bottles, then realize they need more:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Small bottles (~5oz) treat only 1-2 outfits</li>
        <li>Families need enough for multiple people's clothing</li>
        <li>Serious hikers want to treat multiple outfit combinations</li>
        <li>The 24oz size costs less per ounce than small bottles</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The 24oz trigger spray bottle solves all these problems at once.</p>
