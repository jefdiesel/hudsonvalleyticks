    <!-- SECTION 1: ACCESSIBILITY FROM NYC -->
    <section id="accessibility">
        <h2>Getting to Minnewaska State Park from NYC</h2>
        <p>Minnewaska is accessible for day trips or weekend camping getaways. Multiple transportation options make it convenient for families.</p>

        <h3>üöó Driving from NYC (Recommended for Families)</h3>
        <p><strong>Distance:</strong> 90 miles | <strong>Drive Time:</strong> 2-2.5 hours from Manhattan</p>
        <p>Take Henry Hudson Parkway to Route 9 north, connecting to Route 23 toward Gardiner. Follow signs to Minnewaska State Park entrance. Parking is abundant at day-use area ($10-15 per vehicle). Unlike popular Hudson Valley hiking spots, parking rarely fills.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Google Maps: "Minnewaska State Park NY"</li>
            <li>Multiple parking areas available</li>
            <li>Wide roads and good signage</li>
            <li>Overflow parking always available</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Private Shuttle Services</h3>
        <p>Some tour operators offer weekend shuttles from NYC ($30-50 roundtrip). Less common than other Hudson Valley destinations but available for group bookings.</p>

        <h3>Overnight Camping Option</h3>
        <p>Minnewaska offers onsite camping ($15-25 per night). Many families make this a weekend camping trip rather than day hike. Excellent for introducing children to hiking and outdoor recreation.</p>

        <h3>Tick Prevention During Travel</h3>
        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Family Tip:</strong> Change children into full permethrin-treated outfits at parking lot. Explain tick prevention in age-appropriate language: "Ticks are tiny bugs that drink blood. Our special clothes and socks protect us." Normalize tick checks as part of post-hike routine.
        </div>

    <!-- SECTION 2: TRAIL DIFFICULTY & SKILLS -->
    <section id="difficulty">
        <h2>Trail Difficulty & Family-Appropriate Routes</h2>
        <p>Minnewaska offers excellent options for different ages and abilities.</p>

        <h3>Easy Lakeside Walk (2 miles, 1 hour)</h3>
        <p>Gentle loop around Lower Lake with shade and water views. Minimal elevation change. Ideal for young children and first hikes. Appropriate for ages 4+. Tick risk: Moderate (forest habitat).</p>

        <h3>Moderate Waterfall Route (3.5 miles, 2 hours)</h3>
        <p>Popular trail to Minnewaska Falls and then Shawangunk Falls. Some elevation change but well-maintained paths. Excellent scenic payoff. Family-appropriate with decent fitness. Ages 6+. Elevation gain: 300 feet. Tick risk: High (mixed forest).</p>

        <h3>Advanced Lake Circuit (5-6 miles, 3-4 hours)</h3>
        <p>Complete circuit including multiple lakes and views. More challenging terrain and longer distance. For families with hiking experience. Ages 8+. Elevation gain: 600 feet. Tick risk: High.</p>

        <div class="strategy-box">
            <strong>Recommended First-Time Route:</strong> The lakeside walk for young children, or the waterfall route if your family has moderate hiking experience. Both routes are scenic and confidence-building.
        </div>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 3: SEASONAL WEATHER & CONDITIONS -->
    <section id="weather">
        <h2>Seasonal Weather Patterns for Family Hiking</h2>

        <h3>Spring (April-May): Waterfall Season üå∏</h3>
        <p><strong>Temperature:</strong> 50-60¬∞F | <strong>Tick Risk:</strong> Moderate | <strong>Waterfall Flow:</strong> Highest</p>
        <p>Spring snowmelt creates full, dramatic waterfalls‚Äîthe main attraction. Muddy sections possible. Nymph ticks emerge by late April. Perfect season for experiencing Minnewaska's waterfall features with acceptable tick risk.</p>

        <h3>Summer (June-August): Warm & Busy ‚òÄÔ∏è</h3>
        <p><strong>Temperature:</strong> 75-85¬∞F | <strong>Tick Risk:</strong> Very High | <strong>Waterfall Flow:</strong> Moderate</p>
        <p>Clear weather and warm temps make this popular family season. Peak tick season‚Äînymphs extremely active. Lakes offer refreshing swimming opportunity. Crowds are moderate compared to other Hudson Valley trails. Start early to avoid peak afternoon heat.</p>

        <h3>Fall (September-November): Optimal Season üçÇ</h3>
        <p><strong>Temperature:</strong> 55-70¬∞F | <strong>Tick Risk:</strong> High | <strong>Foliage:</strong> Spectacular</p>
        <p>Exceptional conditions with colorful foliage framing lakes and waterfalls. September offers best tick-to-weather ratio. October brings adult ticks. Fewer families present than summer. This is prime season for Minnewaska visits.</p>

        <h3>Winter (December-March): Quiet & Scenic ‚ùÑÔ∏è</h3>
        <p><strong>Temperature:</strong> 25-40¬∞F | <strong>Tick Risk:</strong> Low | <strong>Trails:</strong> Open</p>
        <p>Snowfall creates magical landscapes. Frozen lakes and waterfalls offer unique beauty. Limited crowds. Not ideal for very young children due to cold and potential ice. Otherwise excellent family hiking.</p>

        <div class="warning">
            <strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Water Safety:</strong> Lakes can be cold even in summer. Swimming is permitted but do not allow young children to go alone. Supervise closely and use life jackets if children aren't strong swimmers.

    <!-- SECTION 4: TICK PREVENTION STRATEGY -->
    <section id="tick-prevention">
        <h2>Family Tick Prevention at Minnewaska</h2>
        <p>Even family-friendly easy trails traverse tick habitat. Comprehensive prevention is important for protecting children.</p>

        <h3>Pre-Hike Preparation (Family Version)</h3>
        <div class="strategy-box">
            <strong>Before Leaving Parking Lot:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Dress children in permethrin-treated long pants and long-sleeve shirts</li>
                <li>Tuck pants into treated white socks (kids can see ticks on white)</li>
                <li>Hat or hood for head protection</li>
                <li>Apply picarikin repellent to exposed ankles, wrists, neck</li>
                <li>Have tick removal tools accessible in backpack</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>During the Hike</h3>
        <p>Perform casual tick checks at rest points. Ask children: "Let's look at our white socks‚Äîdo you see any dark specks?" Making it a game prevents tick anxiety while keeping kids engaged in protection.</p>

        <h3>Post-Hike Protocol (Family-Friendly)</h3>
        <p>At home: shower children within 2 hours, perform careful full-body inspection, wash treated clothing separately on high heat. Create a "tick check game" to make it less scary and more normal for children.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Family Tick Education:</strong> Teach children that ticks are a normal part of outdoor recreation. Proper protection and checking make ticks a non-issue. Normalize rather than fear-monger about tick prevention.

    <!-- SECTION 6: DETAILED ROUTE GUIDE -->
    <section id="route-details">
        <h2>Detailed Route Guide: Waterfall Loop (Family Favorite)</h2>

        <h3>Route Summary: 3.5 Miles, 2 Hours, 300ft Elevation Gain</h3>
        <p><strong>Start:</strong> Minnewaska State Park main parking area (yellow-blazed trail)</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>0.0-0.5 mi:</strong> Easy forest walk toward Lower Lake (gentle, scenic)</li>
            <li><strong>0.5-1.5 mi:</strong> Lake overlook and path to Minnewaska Falls (main waterfall, impressive)</li>
            <li><strong>1.5-2.5 mi:</strong> Ascent to Shawangunk Falls (steeper but still manageable, second waterfall)</li>
            <li><strong>2.5-3.5 mi:</strong> Return through forest to parking lot (gradual descent)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Key Waypoints for Families</h3>
        <p><strong>Mile 0.8 (Lower Lake Overlook):</strong> First major scenic point. Rest, snack, and photo opportunity. Kids often get second wind here.</p>
        <p><strong>Mile 1.5 (Minnewaska Falls):</strong> Main waterfall attraction. Spectacular 50+ foot cascade. Take time to enjoy and let kids play safely at base.</p>
        <p><strong>Mile 2.5 (Shawangunk Falls):</strong> Second waterfall, less visited than Minnewaska. Quieter, good spot for family photo.</p>

        <h3>Swimming & Water Activities</h3>
        <p>Lower Lake allows swimming (summer months). Many families plan the hike to include a post-hike swim. Bring swimsuits and towels. Supervised swimming only for children.</p>

        <h3>Best Times for Family Hiking</h3>
        <p>Weekday mornings (especially Tuesday-Thursday) offer optimal conditions: fewer crowds, better tick prevention in off-peak season, and relaxed pacing without weekend rush. September through early October is perfect.</p>

        <h3>Restrooms & Facilities</h3>
        <p>Visitor center at parking area has restrooms, water fountains, and picnic areas. Bathroom breaks available before departing for trail.</p>

    <!-- SECTION 7: FAMILY HIKING TIPS -->
    <section id="family-tips">
        <h2>Family Hiking Tips & Making It Fun</h2>

        <h3>Pace & Expectations</h3>
        <p>Expect to hike 1-1.5 miles per hour with children (vs 2-3 miles with adults). Plan extra time for exploration, snack breaks, and photo opportunities. The destination is less important than the experience together.</p>

        <h3>Motivation & Engagement</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bring trail snacks:</strong> Kids hike better with positive reinforcement</li>
            <li><strong>Make it a game:</strong> "Who can spot the most birds?" or "Let's find the tallest tree"</li>
            <li><strong>Celebrate milestones:</strong> "We're at mile 1! Great work!"</li>
            <li><strong>Give breaks often:</strong> Kids need frequent rest and water</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Tick Prevention Education</h3>
        <p>Use this as teaching moment about outdoor recreation. Explain simply: "Ticks are small bugs that live in the forest. Our special clothes and socks protect us. After we hike, we check ourselves so ticks don't come home." Normalize tick prevention without fear-mongering.</p>

        <h3>Age-Appropriate Recommendations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ages 3-5:</strong> Stick to easy lakeside walks (1-2 miles max)</li>
            <li><strong>Ages 5-8:</strong> Waterfall routes with shorter distances (2-3 miles)</li>
            <li><strong>Ages 8+:</strong> Extended loops and more challenging terrain (4-6 miles)</li>
        </ul>
