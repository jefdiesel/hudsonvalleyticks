         BIKE SAFETY
         ======================================== -->
    <section id="safety">
        <h2>Bike Safety Fundamentals</h2>

        <h3>Helmet Use (Non-Negotiable)</h3>
        <p><strong>Helmets reduce head injury risk by 70%.</strong> Children must wear properly-fitted helmets on every ride, regardless of distance or speed. Model helmet use yourself. Make helmet wearing non-negotiable, like seatbelts in cars.</p>

        <h3>Bike Handling Skills</h3>
        <p>Before trail riding, ensure kids can: (1) Mount and dismount safely, (2) Brake smoothly and stop on demand, (3) Handle turns at appropriate speed, (4) Ride without training wheels. Start on parking lots or quiet streets before trails.</p>

        <h3>Visibility</h3>
        <p>Wear bright colors (neon yellow, orange). Use bike lights and reflectors. Biking on trails is safer than roads, but visibility matters when sharing trails with others.</p>

        <h3>Traffic Awareness</h3>
        <p>Teach kids to: (1) Look both ways before entering parking areas or crossing streets, (2) Signal turns, (3) Ride in single file on narrow paths, (4) Yield to pedestrians and horses.</p>

        <h3>Maintenance Check</h3>
        <p>Before each ride: Check tire pressure, brake function, chain, and seat security. Loose parts cause accidents.</p>

        <div class="warning">
            <strong>Emergency Contact:</strong> Carry ID and emergency contact information. Cell phone with service enables quick help if incidents occur. Know trail exit points to facilitate rescue if needed.
        </div>

    <!-- ========================================
         TICK PREVENTION FOR BIKING
         ======================================== -->
    <section id="ticks">
        <h2>Tick Prevention While Biking</h2>
        <p>Biking through trails and vegetation creates tick exposure opportunities. Columbia County's tick season remains active through October.</p>

        <h3>Pre-Ride Preparation</h3>
        <p>Wear light-colored long pants and long sleeves. Apply permethrin to clothing 1‚Äì2 hours before biking, or wear permethrin-treated clothing. Tuck pants into socks and tuck shirts into waistbands. Most tick exposure occurs during bike mounting/dismounting and rest breaks rather than while actively pedaling.</p>

        <h3>During the Ride</h3>
        <p>Stay on marked trails‚Äîriding off-trail increases tick exposure. Avoid brushing against overhanging vegetation and low brush. Maintain awareness of tick-favorable terrain (tall grass, brush areas). Speed offers some protection‚Äîfaster movement creates wind that can blow crawling ticks off.</p>

        <h3>Rest Break Precautions</h3>
        <p>When stopping for water breaks or rest, tuck long pants into socks and maintain visibility of lower legs. Avoid sitting directly on grass or brush‚Äîuse bike seats or stand. Inspect legs and skin every 20‚Äì30 minutes of riding.</p>

        <h3>Post-Ride Protocol</h3>
        <p>Change clothes immediately upon arriving home. Wash all biking clothing in hot water. Inspect children thoroughly‚Äîticks often attach at sock lines, behind ears, hairline, and in skin folds. Shower within 2 hours if possible. Check bikes and gear for hitchhiking ticks.</p>

        <div class="warning">
            <strong>Important:</strong> Approximately 30% of deer ticks in Columbia County carry Lyme disease. If a tick is found, remove immediately using fine-point tweezers. Grasp close to skin and pull steadily upward. Save the tick and monitor for "bull's-eye" rash or flu-like symptoms over following weeks.

         AGE-APPROPRIATE BIKING
         ======================================== -->
    <section id="ages">
        <h2>Age-Appropriate Biking Guidelines</h2>

        <h3>Ages 3‚Äì5 (Balance Bikes & Training Wheels)</h3>
        <p>Start with balance bikes (no pedals) on flat terrain. Transition to training wheels on very flat, paved areas. Focus on confidence and enjoyment. Short rides (1‚Äì2 miles) on smooth surfaces. Parking lot riding before street/trail cycling.</p>

        <h3>Ages 5‚Äì7 (Pedal Bikes on Flat Trails)</h3>
        <p>Pedal bikes with training wheels or stabilizers on flat, smooth paths. Ride on dedicated bike trails. Distances 2‚Äì4 miles. Perfect introduction to trail biking with flat rail trail routes. Adult supervision constant and close.</p>

        <h3>Ages 7‚Äì9 (Independent Trail Riding)</h3>
        <p>Pedal bikes without training wheels on moderate flat-to-rolling trails. Distances 4‚Äì8 miles with multiple rest breaks. Kids this age can manage hills and more technical terrain. Still require adult supervision but can ride independently within visual distance.</p>

        <h3>Ages 10+ (Advanced Trail Biking)</h3>
        <p>Capable of 8+ mile rides with elevation changes. Single-track trails and more technical terrain. Mountain biking skills development. May ride ahead of parents (but supervised). Competitive and fitness-focused opportunities available.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Let kids set pace on family rides. Slower rides that keep kids happy are infinitely better than fast rides that create frustration. Frequent rest breaks, water stops, and destinations (scenic viewpoint, ice cream, park) maintain engagement.

    <!-- ========================================
         FALL BIKING SEASON ADVANTAGES
         ======================================== -->
    <section id="season">
        <h2>Why Fall is Ideal for Family Biking</h2>

        <h3>Temperature Comfort</h3>
        <p>September temperatures (70‚Äì75¬∞F) and October temperatures (60‚Äì65¬∞F) are ideal for biking. Not too hot for extended effort, not too cold for comfort. Midday temperatures create perfect conditions‚Äîearly morning and evening still cool.</p>

        <h3>Low Humidity</h3>
        <p>Fall humidity drops significantly. Physical exertion that would feel exhausting in humid summer is refreshing in dry fall air. Kids maintain better endurance and fewer heat-related complaints.</p>

        <h3>Scenic Foliage</h3>
        <p>Fall colors peak mid-October. Biking through tree-lined trails with autumn foliage creates memorable experiences. Kids stay engaged by scenery. Photography opportunities appeal to older kids.</p>

        <h3>Moderate Trail Conditions</h3>
        <p>Fall trails are dry (no summer mud) and clear (leaves haven't fully covered hazards). Excellent riding conditions. Less crowded than summer.</p>
