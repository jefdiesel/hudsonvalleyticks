    <!-- SECTION 1: ACCESSIBILITY FROM NYC -->
    <section id="accessibility">
        <h2>Getting to Harlem Valley Rail Trail from NYC</h2>
        <p>Harlem Valley Rail Trail offers exceptional value: zero driving stress, abundant parking, and completely flat walking surface.</p>

        <h3>üöó Driving to Trailhead</h3>
        <p><strong>Distance:</strong> 95 miles | <strong>Drive Time:</strong> 2-2.5 hours from Manhattan</p>
        <p>Route 9 north to Millerton, NY area. Multiple trailhead parking areas available. Free parking at all access points. Easy navigation from major roads.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Google Maps: "Harlem Valley Rail Trail"</li>
            <li>Multiple parking areas along trail</li>
            <li>Free parking at all locations</li>
            <li>Wheelchair-accessible sections</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Trail Access Points</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Millerton Depot:</strong> Main trailhead with amenities</li>
            <li><strong>Harlem Valley Duell Street:</strong> Mid-trail access</li>
            <li><strong>Copake:</strong> Southern access point</li>
            <li><strong>Pine Plains:</strong> Northern extension</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Flexible Hiking Options</h3>
        <p>Park at one location, walk out-and-back. Or use two vehicles for point-to-point hikes. Trail is linear‚Äîreturn to starting point or arrange shuttle.</p>

        <h3>Tick Prevention on Flat Terrain</h3>
        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Flat Trail, Real Risk:</strong> Don't underestimate tick exposure because trail is flat and easy. Adjacent fields and forest support significant tick populations. Comprehensive prevention essential regardless of difficulty level.
        </div>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 2: TRAIL DIFFICULTY & SKILLS -->
    <section id="difficulty">
        <h2>Trail Difficulty & Route Options</h2>
        <p>Harlem Valley Rail Trail is universally easy‚Äîperfect for all fitness levels.</p>

        <h3>Short Leisurely Walk (2-3 miles, 1-1.5 hours)</h3>
        <p>Perfect introduction. Start at Millerton, walk section, return. Zero elevation, hard packed surface. Accessible for ages 3-90+. Tick risk: Moderate (adjacent fields).</p>

        <h3>Half-Day Excursion (5-8 miles, 2.5-4 hours)</h3>
        <p>Park and hike to next access point. Walk at own pace, rest at junction. No time pressure. Tick risk: Moderate-High (extended exposure).</p>

        <h3>Full Trail Segment (10-15 miles, 5-7 hours)</h3>
        <p>Complete section traversal. Requires shuttle option or very long day. For serious hikers and cyclists. Tick risk: High (extended exposure to trail environment).</p>

        <div class="strategy-box">
            <strong>Recommended First Visit:</strong> 4-5 mile round trip from Millerton. Leisurely pace, multiple rest stops, return by mid-afternoon. Provides complete Harlem Valley experience in 3-4 hours total.

    <!-- SECTION 3: SEASONAL WEATHER & CONDITIONS -->
    <section id="weather">
        <h2>Seasonal Weather Patterns & Trail Conditions</h2>

        <h3>Spring (April-May): Muddy Season üå∏</h3>
        <p><strong>Temperature:</strong> 50-65¬∞F | <strong>Tick Risk:</strong> Moderate | <strong>Surface:</strong> Muddy</p>
        <p>Recent snowmelt creates muddy/wet sections. Rail grade holds water. Nymph ticks emerging. Wear appropriate footwear. Not ideal for light shoes.</p>

        <h3>Summer (June-August): Peak Season ‚òÄÔ∏è</h3>
        <p><strong>Temperature:</strong> 75-85¬∞F | <strong>Tick Risk:</strong> High | <strong>Surface:</strong> Excellent</p>
        <p>Dry, walkable surface. Ideal conditions. Peak tick season. Trail can be crowded weekends. Start early for coolest walking and fewer people.</p>

        <h3>Fall (September-November): Optimal Season üçÇ</h3>
        <p><strong>Temperature:</strong> 55-70¬∞F | <strong>Tick Risk:</strong> Moderate-High | <strong>Foliage:</strong> Beautiful</p>
        <p>Best conditions with clear skies and comfortable temps. Fall colors frame trail. September ideal for tick-weather balance. October brings adult ticks.</p>

        <h3>Winter (December-March): Quiet & Icy ‚ùÑÔ∏è</h3>
        <p><strong>Temperature:</strong> 20-40¬∞F | <strong>Tick Risk:</strong> Low | <strong>Surface:</strong> Possible ice</p>
        <p>Peaceful trail with few people. Packed snow possible. Rail grade can ice. Proper footwear essential. Otherwise excellent low-tick season.</p>

        <div class="warning">
            <strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Surface Conditions:</strong> Check weather before heading out. Muddy sections in spring, icy in winter, dust-dry in summer. Wear appropriate footwear for seasonal conditions.

    <!-- SECTION 4: TICK PREVENTION STRATEGY -->
    <section id="tick-prevention">
        <h2>Harlem Valley Rail Trail Tick Prevention</h2>
        <p>Flat, open trail creates false sense of safety. Adjacent fields and forest support significant ticks. Comprehensive prevention essential.</p>

        <h3>Pre-Trail Preparation</h3>
        <div class="strategy-box">
            <ul>
                <li>Long pants tucked into white socks</li>
                <li>Long-sleeve shirt preferred</li>
                <li>Picarikin repellent applied to exposed skin</li>
                <li>Hat or hood for head protection</li>
                <li>Removal tools in pack/pocket</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>During Trail Walking</h3>
        <p>Perform visual tick checks every 30 minutes. Check white socks and clothing frequently. If tick found crawling, remove immediately using proper technique. Flat trail surface makes tick detection easier than forest hiking.</p>

        <h3>Post-Trail Protocol</h3>
        <p>Shower within 2 hours. Full-body inspection including hairline, behind ears, armpits, groin. Wash clothes separately on high heat. Dry on high setting.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Rail Trail Misconception:</strong> "Easy trail = safe from ticks." FALSE. Adjacent fields are prime tick habitat. Flat surface doesn't reduce tick exposure. Maintain full protection despite ease of walking.
