    <!-- SECTION 1: ACCESSIBILITY FROM NYC -->
    <section id="accessibility">
        <h2>Getting to Lake Taghkanic State Park from NYC</h2>
        <p>Lake Taghkanic offers accessible recreation with abundant parking and family amenities. Perfect for weekend day trips.</p>

        <h3>üöó Driving from NYC</h3>
        <p><strong>Distance:</strong> 95 miles | <strong>Drive Time:</strong> 2-2.5 hours from Manhattan</p>
        <p>Route 9 north through Hudson Valley to Ancram, NY. Follow signs to Lake Taghkanic State Park. Large day-use parking available ($10 per vehicle). Rarely fills even on busy weekends due to ample parking.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Google Maps: "Lake Taghkanic State Park"</li>
            <li>Easy navigation from Route 9</li>
            <li>Multiple parking areas at park</li>
            <li>Excellent visitor amenities</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>üèïÔ∏è Overnight Camping Option</h3>
        <p><strong>Cost:</strong> $20-30 per night | <strong>Availability:</strong> May-October</p>
        <p>Lakeside camping available at park. Makes this a full weekend trip destination. Swimming, hiking, camping all in one location. Excellent value for families.</p>

        <h3>üèä Recreation Beyond Hiking</h3>
        <p>Lake Taghkanic offers swimming beaches, boat rentals, fishing access, and picnic areas. Hiking is just one activity. Plan full day combining multiple recreation types.</p>

        <h3>Tick Prevention for Water Recreation</h3>
        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Water-to-Trail Transition:</strong> Change into permethrin-treated gear BEFORE walking trails, not after swimming. Lake water doesn't kill ticks. Post-swim tick exposure is same as any hiking.
        </div>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 2: TRAIL DIFFICULTY & SKILLS -->
    <section id="difficulty">
        <h2>Trail Difficulty & Route Options</h2>
        <p>Lake Taghkanic offers excellent variety for all fitness levels.</p>

        <h3>Easy Lakeside Loop (3 miles, 1.5 hours)</h3>
        <p>Flat walk around lake perimeter with consistent water views. Minimal elevation change. Ideal for families, seniors, and casual hikers. Tick risk: Moderate (forest/field transition).</p>

        <h3>Moderate Woodland Loop (4.5 miles, 2.5 hours)</h3>
        <p>Combines lakeside with inland woodland section. Some gentle elevation changes. More challenging than lakeside loop but still very accessible. Tick risk: Moderate-High (mixed habitat).</p>

        <h3>Extended Circuit (6+ miles, 3-4 hours)</h3>
        <p>Complete circumnavigation combining all trail sections. Appropriate for fit recreational hikers. Some technical footing in woodland sections. Tick risk: High.</p>

        <div class="strategy-box">
            <strong>Perfect Family Route:</strong> Lakeside loop (3 mi) in morning, swim mid-day, picnic lunch, optional woodland section afternoon if energy remains.

    <!-- SECTION 3: SEASONAL WEATHER & CONDITIONS -->
    <section id="weather">
        <h2>Seasonal Weather Patterns & Lake Conditions</h2>

        <h3>Spring (April-May): Renewal üå∏</h3>
        <p><strong>Temperature:</strong> 50-65¬∞F | <strong>Tick Risk:</strong> Moderate | <strong>Swimming:</strong> Cold</p>
        <p>Wildflowers bloom around lake. Comfortable walking weather. Nymph ticks emerge late April. Water too cold for swimming. Ideal for hiking-focused visits.</p>

        <h3>Summer (June-August): Peak Season ‚òÄÔ∏è</h3>
        <p><strong>Temperature:</strong> 75-85¬∞F | <strong>Tick Risk:</strong> High | <strong>Swimming:</strong> Ideal</p>
        <p>Clear weather, warm lake, busy weekends. Peak tick season. Start early for cooler morning hiking. Post-hike swimming is popular combination.</p>

        <h3>Fall (September-November): Optimal Season üçÇ</h3>
        <p><strong>Temperature:</strong> 55-70¬∞F | <strong>Tick Risk:</strong> Moderate-High | <strong>Foliage:</strong> Spectacular</p>
        <p>Excellent hiking conditions with fall colors reflected in lake. September offers best tick-to-weather ratio. Swimming still possible but cold. Fewer crowds than summer.</p>

        <h3>Winter (December-March): Quiet Season ‚ùÑÔ∏è</h3>
        <p><strong>Temperature:</strong> 20-35¬∞F | <strong>Tick Risk:</strong> Low | <strong>Access:</strong> Limited</p>
        <p>Peaceful lake with few people. Frozen surfaces possible. Park may have limited facilities. Ice over lake allows different perspective but reduces recreation options.</p>

        <div class="warning">
            <strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Swimming Safety:</strong> Lake swimming allowed only in designated areas during summer. Lifeguards on duty seasonally. Supervise children closely. Lake water can be cold even in summer.

    <!-- SECTION 4: TICK PREVENTION STRATEGY -->
    <section id="tick-prevention">
        <h2>Lake Taghkanic Tick Prevention: Water Doesn't Help</h2>
        <p>Water recreation doesn't reduce tick exposure. Comprehensive prevention essential despite water-based activities.</p>

        <h3>Pre-Trail Preparation</h3>
        <div class="strategy-box">
            <ul>
                <li>Long pants tucked into treated white socks</li>
                <li>Long-sleeve treated shirt</li>
                <li>Hat or hood for head protection</li>
                <li>Picarikin repellent applied before hiking</li>
                <li>Bring extra clothing for post-swim change</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Water Recreation Logistics</h3>
        <p>Hike first (2-3 hours) in protective gear. Return to parking. Change into swimsuit for post-hike swim. After swimming, change into fresh dry clothes (kept in car). Perform tick check before leaving park.</p>

        <h3>Post-Hike & Post-Swim</h3>
        <p>When returning home, shower regardless of swimming. Perform full-body tick inspection. Wash hiking clothes separately on high heat. Dry on high setting.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Common Misconception:</strong> "Swimming will wash ticks off." FALSE. Ticks resist water immersion. Hiking in water environment same tick risk as hiking in forest. Maintain protection throughout.
