    </section>

    <!-- INTRO SECTION -->
    <section class="section" tabindex="0" id="intro">
        <p>Fall foliage season in the Hudson Valley is magical. The weather cools, the leaves turn brilliant shades of red and gold, and the hiking trails come alive with visitors from across the Northeast. But there's one threat that many leaf peepers overlook: <strong>adult blacklegged ticks are at peak season from August through November.</strong></p>
        
        <div class="intro-box">
            <strong>üî¥ Critical fact:</strong> Adult ticks are larger and easier to spot than nymphs, BUT they're twice as likely to carry Lyme disease bacteria. According to a January 2025 Dartmouth study, <strong>50% of adult blacklegged ticks in the Northeast carry Lyme disease</strong>. That means the autumn hike you're planning has a 1-in-2 chance of encountering an infected tick.
        </div>

        <p>The good news? With the right preparation and the 5 essential items covered in this guide, you can reduce your tick exposure by up to 95% and hike safely during peak foliage season.</p>

    <!-- WHY FALL IS DIFFERENT -->
    <section class="section" tabindex="0" id="why-fall-is-different">
        <h2>Why Fall Tick Season Is Different (And More Dangerous)</h2>
        
        <p>You might think that cooler weather means fewer ticks. You'd be wrong. Fall tick season in Hudson Valley is actually one of the most dangerous times to be outdoors.</p>
        
        <h3>The Biology of Fall Ticks</h3>
        <p>Adult blacklegged ticks emerge from their summer dormancy in August and become extremely active from September through November. Unlike spring and early summer (when smaller, harder-to-spot nymph ticks are the threat), fall ticks are <strong>large enough to see</strong> but <strong>aggressive hunters</strong> looking to feed before winter.</p>
        
        <p>Here's the critical difference: Adult ticks are <strong>actively seeking human hosts</strong>. They don't wait in vegetation passively‚Äîthey crawl toward movement and body heat. If you're hiking through tall grass or brush during leaf season, you're in their hunting zone.</p>
        
        <h3>Why Hudson Valley Fall Hiking Is Particularly High-Risk</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Peak population numbers:</strong> Fall sees adult tick populations at their annual maximum across the Hudson Valley</li>
            <li><strong>Higher infection rates:</strong> These older ticks have fed all season and accumulated Lyme disease bacteria from infected hosts</li>
            <li><strong>Longer attachment times:</strong> Adult ticks are harder to dislodge, meaning infection risk skyrockets after 24-36 hours</li>
            <li><strong>Trail congestion:</strong> Hudson Valley's most popular hiking trails are packed during peak foliage (late September to mid-October), meaning more humans = more ticks = more risk</li>
            <li><strong>Lower vegetation:</strong> As leaves fall, tall brush becomes more visible but ticks remain hidden in leaf litter and ground-level vegetation</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Bottom line: <strong>Fall foliage season requires the most aggressive tick prevention strategy of the entire year.</strong></p>

    <!-- LAYERED DEFENSE -->
    <section class="section" tabindex="0" id="layered-defense">
        <h2>The Layered Defense Strategy: How to Achieve 95%+ Protection</h2>
        
        <p>CDC and outdoor health professionals recommend a "layered defense" approach because no single prevention method is 100% effective. By combining multiple strategies, you can reduce tick exposure from 100% risk to less than 5%.</p>
        
        <h3>The 5-Layer Protection Model</h3>
        <div class="strategy-box">
            <p><strong>Layer 1: Physical Barrier</strong> - Permethrin-treated clothing (kills ticks on contact)</p>
            <p><strong>Layer 2: Skin Protection</strong> - DEET or Picaridan repellent on exposed skin (repels and kills ticks)</p>
            <p><strong>Layer 3: Protective Gear</strong> - White clothing + leg gaiters (makes ticks visible + blocks entry)</p>
            <p><strong>Layer 4: Regular Inspection</strong> - Tick checks during and after hiking (catches ticks before attachment)</p>
            <p><strong>Layer 5: Rapid Removal</strong> - Proper removal tools + technique (removes ticks before transmission begins)</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>When all five layers are active, your protection rating jumps to 95%+. Here's why each layer matters:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Clothing alone:</strong> 70% protection (ticks can crawl past edges)</li>
            <li><strong>Clothing + repellent:</strong> 85% protection (better coverage but some ticks still make it through)</li>
            <li><strong>Clothing + repellent + white pants:</strong> 90% protection (visibility catches the stragglers)</li>
            <li><strong>Clothing + repellent + white pants + leg gaiters:</strong> 94% protection (gaiter barrier catches crawlers)</li>
            <li><strong>Full layered approach + tick checks + removal tools:</strong> 95%+ protection (comprehensive defense)</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- INVESTMENT -->
    <section class="section" tabindex="0" id="investment">
        <h2>Your Total Investment for Maximum Fall Safety</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Combined cost: $112‚Äì$151 for complete protection</strong></p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Permethrin pants: $50‚Äì$65</li>
            <li>White hiking socks: $15‚Äì$20</li>

    <!-- TICK CHECK -->
    <section class="section" tabindex="0" id="tick-check">
        <h2>The Tick Check Protocol: Your Mid-Hike and Post-Hike Routine</h2>
        
        <p>Having the right gear is only half the battle. You also need a systematic inspection routine to catch ticks before they attach.</p>
        
        <h3>During the Hike (Every 2‚Äì3 Hours)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Stop for a break and look down at your white socks. Any dark spots? Those might be ticks crawling up.</li>
            <li>Brush your legs thoroughly from thigh to ankle, moving downward (this brushes ticks off before they climb higher)</li>
            <li>Check your arms, neck, and face (any place not covered by permethrin)</li>
            <li>Use your phone to take a photo of your entire body from front and back‚Äîzoom in later to check for attached ticks</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>After the Hike (Within 2 Hours of Returning Home)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove all clothes immediately and put them in a dryer on high heat for 10 minutes. This kills any ticks still on fabric.</li>
            <li>Shower within 2 hours of returning indoors. This washes off crawling ticks before they attach.</li>
            <li>Pay special attention to: behind ears, back of neck, underarms, groin, behind knees, and between toes (places ticks love)</li>
            <li>Inspect the entire body thoroughly. Use a mirror or ask a family member to check your back</li>
            <li>If you find a tick, use your TickCheck kit to remove it properly</li>
        </ol>
        
        <div class="warning">
            <strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Critical timing:</strong> Ticks need 24‚Äì36 hours to transmit Lyme disease bacteria. If you find and remove a tick within the first 24 hours, your infection risk drops to near-zero.
