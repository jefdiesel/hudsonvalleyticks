    <h1>🌱 Create a Tick-Free Yard: Complete Gardening Guide</h1>
    <p>Evidence-based landscaping, mowing, and yard maintenance strategies to eliminate ticks from your Hudson Valley outdoor space</p>
</section>

<section class="section" tabindex="0" id="intro">
    <div class="intro-box">
        <strong>📊 Critical Fact:</strong> Over 80% of tick bites occur on homeowners' own property. A tick-free yard is the foundation of tick prevention—combined with permethrin-treated clothing and skin repellents, proper landscaping creates near-total protection.
    </div>

    <p>Your backyard should be a safe haven for your family, but ticks have other ideas. These blood-sucking parasites thrive in tall grass, leaf piles, and humid shaded areas—the very environments many homeowners create without realizing it.</p>

    <p>The good news? <strong>You can make your yard naturally tick-hostile through strategic landscaping, proper maintenance, and innovative solutions like tick tubes.</strong> This comprehensive guide covers everything from mowing height to tick-repelling plants, plus the exact products that work.</p>

<section class="section" tabindex="0" id="mowing-strategy">
    <h2>1. Mowing: Your First Line of Defense</h2>

    <h3>Keep Grass Short (3 Inches or Less)</h3>
    <p>Tall grass is tick paradise. It provides moisture, shade, and ideal harborage for ticks waiting to latch onto passing animals or humans. <strong>Maintaining grass at 3 inches or shorter drastically reduces tick habitat.</strong></p>

    <p>Why this works: Ticks cannot tolerate dry, open, sunny areas. Short grass means:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>More sunlight reaches the ground, drying out tick habitat</li>
        <li>Reduced humidity where ticks hide</li>
        <li>Easy spotting of ticks if they are present</li>
        <li>Better airflow that creates unfavorable conditions</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Mowing Frequency</h3>
    <p>During peak tick season (spring through fall in Hudson Valley), <strong>mow at least once weekly</strong>. This prevents ticks from establishing long-term populations. Consider mowing twice weekly in July and August when tick populations peak.</p>

    <h3>Focus on Edges</h3>
    <p>Ticks accumulate along property edges, fence lines, and boundaries with wooded areas. <strong>Pay extra attention to edging and trimming brush along your property perimeter.</strong> Use a string trimmer or weed whacker to clear tall grass and brush in these high-risk zones.</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Mow in early morning or late evening when it's cool. Wear long, light-colored pants tucked into white socks to spot any ticks that climb onto your clothing during mowing. Do a full tick check immediately after finishing.
    </div>

<section class="section" tabindex="0" id="raking-leaves">
    <h2>2. Raking & Leaf Management: Destroy Tick Nurseries</h2>

    <p><strong>Fallen leaves are tick incubators.</strong> Decomposing leaf litter creates the cool, moist, shaded environment where tick larvae thrive. A single pile of leaves can harbor thousands of tick nymphs waiting to infect your family.</p>

    <h3>Fall Leaf Cleanup Protocol</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Rake thoroughly</strong> in fall (September-November) to remove all accumulated leaf litter, especially near play areas, patios, and walkways</li>
        <li><strong>Don't pile leaves near your home or family gathering areas</strong>—move piles to the back corner of your property or compost them</li>
        <li><strong>Spring cleanup</strong> is equally important. Winter leaves that thaw can harbor emerging tick nymphs in May</li>
        <li><strong>Clear gutters and downspouts</strong> that collect leaves—water pooling with leaves creates ideal tick habitat</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Year-Round Leaf Management</h3>
    <p>Don't wait for fall. <strong>Remove fallen branches, twigs, and debris throughout the year.</strong> These organic materials provide harborage for ticks and the small mammals (mice, chipmunks) that carry Lyme disease bacteria.</p>

    <h3>Compost Safely</h3>
    <p>If you compost leaves, use a proper hot-composting method that reaches 140°F or higher to kill ticks. Do not leave piles as-is—these become tick breeding grounds. Consider purchasing a sealed compost bin kept away from play areas.</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>⚠️ Warning:</strong> One patient reported being bitten by a tick while picking up a leaf pile in late summer. Never handle leaf piles with bare hands. Wear gloves, long sleeves, and tucked-in pants.
    </div>

<section class="section" tabindex="0" id="dry-barriers">
    <h2>3. Create 3-Foot Dry Barriers</h2>

    <p>Ticks hate dry, open spaces. <strong>A 3-foot-wide border of gravel, wood chips, or mulch creates a physical and environmental barrier</strong> that prevents ticks from migrating from wooded areas into your lawn and living spaces.</p>

    <h3>Where to Install Barriers</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Between your lawn and any adjacent woods or brushy areas</li>
        <li>Around patios, decks, and play equipment</li>
        <li>Along fence lines, especially if backing to natural areas</li>
        <li>Around garden beds and flower areas</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Best Materials</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Wood chips</strong> — least expensive, naturally tick-repellent, aesthetically pleasing</li>
        <li><strong>Gravel</strong> — long-lasting, creates inhospitable dry environment</li>
        <li><strong>Cedar mulch</strong> — tick-repellent due to natural aromatic oils (premium option)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Maintain these barriers by raking out fallen leaves and debris that could create new tick habitat within the barrier itself. Refresh annually to maintain effectiveness.</p>

    <h2>4. Plant Tick-Repelling Species</h2>

    <p><strong>Certain plants emit natural compounds that deter ticks and the animals that carry them.</strong> Strategic placement of these aromatic plants creates a naturally fortified perimeter while enhancing your landscape's beauty.</p>

    <h3>Top Tick-Repelling Plants</h3>

    <h4>🌿 Lavender</h4>
    <p>One of the strongest tick repellents. Plant in borders around patios, decks, and walkways. Bees and butterflies love it. Full sun, well-drained soil.</p>

    <h4>🌿 Rosemary</h4>
    <p>Aromatic perennial that thrives in Hudson Valley gardens. Use fresh sprigs in cooking while protecting your yard. Full sun preferred.</p>

    <h4>🌿 Sage</h4>
    <p>Hardy perennial with powerful tick-repelling scent. Attracts beneficial pollinators. Plant in clusters for maximum effect.</p>

    <h4>🌿 Mint (Peppermint & Spearmint)</h4>
    <p>Highly invasive (contain in pots or raised beds). Strong scent deters ticks. Bonus: great for tea. Shade tolerant.</p>

    <h4>🌿 Marigolds</h4>
    <p>Annual flowers containing pyrethrum (natural insecticide). Plant in garden borders and around play areas. Full sun, easy to grow.</p>

    <h4>🌿 Garlic</h4>
    <p>Plant garlic cloves in fall for spring harvest. Repels ticks and deer. Edge garden beds with garlic for double protection.</p>

    <h4>🌿 Beautyberry</h4>
    <p>Attractive shrub with purple berries. Deer-resistant, tick-repelling. Moderate to full sun.</p>

    <h3>Strategic Planting Plan</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Create a perimeter of tick-repelling plants around patios, decks, and play equipment</li>
        <li>Plant clusters near entry points to your home</li>
        <li>Use raised beds with cedar wood for enhanced protection</li>
        <li>Container gardens (large pots) work for mint and smaller plants</li>
        <li>Plan for year-round coverage—mix perennials (lavender, rosemary, sage) with annuals (marigolds)</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Bonus Benefit:</strong> These plants attract pollinators (bees, butterflies) while repelling ticks. You're creating a vibrant, natural garden that also deters deer and rodents—the primary tick carriers.

    <h2>5. Strategic Landscape Design</h2>

    <p><strong>Ticks prefer shady, moist, protected areas.</strong> Redesigning your yard to maximize sunlight and airflow makes it naturally tick-hostile.</p>

    <h3>Sun & Airflow</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Trim tree limbs to allow more sunlight to reach the ground</li>
        <li>Remove low-hanging branches that create shaded tunnels</li>
        <li>Thin dense shrubs to improve airflow</li>
        <li>Prune branches away from walkways and play areas</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Move Play Equipment Away from Edges</h3>
    <p><strong>Position swing sets, sandboxes, and trampolines in open, sunny areas of your yard—away from wooded edges and property perimeters.</strong> This removes them from high-tick-risk zones where ticks migrate from natural areas.</p>

    <h3>Create Open Gathering Spaces</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Place patios and deck furniture in full-sun areas</li>
        <li>Install stone hardscaping instead of grass in high-use areas</li>
        <li>Maintain clear sight lines—no hiding spots for ticks</li>
        <li>Consider shade structures (pergolas with open sides) for airflow</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Firewood Storage</h3>
    <p>Improperly stored firewood attracts rodents and ticks. Store wood:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>On gravel or concrete (not directly on soil)</li>
        <li>Away from your house and property edges</li>
        <li>Covered but ventilated (allows airflow)</li>
        <li>In a neat, organized stack</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Deploy Tick Tubes: Harvard's Innovative Solution</h2>

    <p><strong>Tick tubes are Harvard-developed biodegradable tubes filled with permethrin-treated cotton that mice use as nesting material—killing ticks without harming mice, pets, or beneficial insects.</strong> This is one of the most innovative, chemical-efficient tick control methods available.</p>

    <h3>How Tick Tubes Work</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Permethrin-treated cotton fills biodegradable cardboard tubes</li>
        <li>Mice naturally collect the cotton for nesting material</li>
        <li>As mice use the cotton, ticks in their nests are eliminated</li>
        <li>This breaks the tick life cycle by killing larval ticks before they mature into nymphs</li>
        <li>No spraying, no broad-spectrum pesticides, no harm to pets or people</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Deployment Timeline & Dosage</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Deploy in late July or early August</strong> when larval ticks are emerging</li>
        <li><strong>Dosage:</strong> 24 tubes per acre (or about 3-4 tubes per 1,000 sq. ft. of lawn)</li>
        <li><strong>Placement:</strong> Distribute evenly around yard perimeter, near woods, and along fence lines</li>
        <li><strong>Reapply annually</strong> for sustained control</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Manage Tick-Carrying Wildlife</h2>

    <p><strong>Deer and rodents are the primary tick transporters.</strong> Managing these animals on your property significantly reduces tick populations over time.</p>

    <h3>Deer Management</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Install 8-foot deer fencing</strong> around gardens and landscaped areas (can reduce ticks by 90% over time)</li>
        <li><strong>Plant deer-resistant vegetation:</strong> boxwood, barberry, butterfly bush</li>
        <li><strong>Remove bird feeders or move to property edge</strong> (birds scatter seed that attracts deer)</li>
        <li><strong>Remove salt licks and mineral supplements</strong> that attract deer</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Rodent Management</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Remove trash and food sources</strong> that attract mice and squirrels</li>
        <li><strong>Use sealed trash and compost containers</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Keep bird feeders clean—remove spilled seed immediately</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Seal gaps under sheds, decks, and crawlspaces</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Store firewood off ground, away from structures</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Natural Deterrents</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Motion-activated sprinklers (startle deer humanely)</li>
        <li>Plant aromatic herbs that deer dislike (lavender, rosemary)</li>
        <li>Remove shelter where rodents nest</li>
    </ul>
