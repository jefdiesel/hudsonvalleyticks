        <strong>üìä Critical Fact:</strong> 80% of tick bites happen at home or near your property. Your yard is prime tick habitat and the best place to start your prevention strategy.
    </div>

    <p>Here's a fact that surprises many people: most tick bites don't happen on distant hiking trails. They happen in your own yard.</p>

    <p>A CDC study found that 80% of tick-borne Lyme disease cases occurred when people were bitten in or around their homes. Your property‚Äîthe grass, shrubs, and wooded edges‚Äîis prime tick habitat in the Hudson Valley.</p>

    <p>The good news? You can dramatically reduce ticks on your property through a combination of landscaping, targeted treatments, and smart yard management. This guide walks you through every strategy.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Your Yard's Tick Risk</h2>

    <h3>High-Risk Areas</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tall grass and overgrown vegetation:</strong> Ticks love to hide here waiting for hosts</li>
        <li><strong>Dense shrubs and bushes:</strong> Provide perfect shelter and breeding ground</li>
        <li><strong>Leaf litter and fallen branches:</strong> Tick nurseries and hiding spots</li>
        <li><strong>Wooded edges:</strong> Ticks migrate from woods into your yard</li>
        <li><strong>Shaded, damp areas:</strong> Ticks seek moisture; sunny, dry areas have fewer ticks</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Low-Risk Areas</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Maintained open lawn</li>
        <li>Sunny, exposed areas</li>
        <li>Regularly cleared spaces</li>
        <li>Areas away from vegetation and wildlife</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="pro-tip">
        <strong>üí° Pro Tip:</strong> Create a "tick-safe zone" immediately around your home by clearing vegetation 3-5 feet back from the foundation and keeping lawn short (less than 1.5 inches).

    <h2>Landscaping: Your First Line of Defense</h2>

    <h3>Mow Your Lawn Regularly</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Keep lawn under 1.5 inches tall</li>
        <li>Mow weekly during tick season</li>
        <li>Bag clippings to remove tick habitats</li>
        <li>Avoid letting grass get overgrown</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Clear Dead Wood and Leaf Litter</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Remove fallen branches and dead wood</li>
        <li>Clear leaf litter from flower beds and under shrubs</li>
        <li>These are prime tick breeding grounds</li>
        <li>Don't create large brush piles near the house</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Trim Back Vegetation</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Remove lower branches of trees (6+ feet off ground)</li>
        <li>Trim shrub bottoms to eliminate tick movement pathways</li>
        <li>Create space between trees and lawn for air circulation</li>
        <li>Separate vegetation from your home's perimeter</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Use Mulch Strategically</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Wood chips and gravel create hostile environments for ticks</li>
        <li>Place 3-inch wood chip borders between lawn and vegetation</li>
        <li>This helps prevent ticks from migrating to your lawn</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Treating Your Yard: Chemical Options</h2>

    <h3>Yard Sprays</h3>
    <p>Permethrin-based yard sprays kill ticks on contact and last 2-3 weeks:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cutter Backyard Bug Control:</strong> Affordable, effective for targeted areas</li>
        <li><strong>Bifenthrin sprays:</strong> Professional-grade, longer-lasting</li>
        <li><strong>Timing:</strong> Apply in spring (May-June) and fall (September-October)</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="warning">
        <strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note:</strong> Chemical sprays kill beneficial insects too. Use sparingly and target high-risk areas (edges, near seating areas) rather than spraying your entire yard.

    <h3>Natural Yard Treatments</h3>
    <p>If you prefer to avoid chemicals:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Diatomaceous earth:</strong> Food-grade DE can reduce tick populations (reapply after rain)</li>
        <li><strong>Cedar oil sprays:</strong> Tick repellent but requires frequent application</li>
        <li><strong>Nematodes:</strong> Beneficial predatory nematodes can reduce tick larvae (seasonal)</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="pro-tip">
        <strong>üí° Pro Tip:</strong> Natural treatments require more frequent application and may be less effective than chemical options, but they're a good choice if you have kids or pets playing in the yard constantly.
