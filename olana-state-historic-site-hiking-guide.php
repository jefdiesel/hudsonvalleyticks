    <!-- SECTION 4: TICK PREVENTION STRATEGY -->
    <section id="tick-prevention">
        <h2>Olana Tick Prevention: Historic Setting, Real Risk</h2>
        <p>Olana's open meadows and forest sections both support tick populations. Despite "historic site" perception, comprehensive prevention is essential.</p>

        <h3>Pre-Trail Preparation</h3>
        <div class="strategy-box">
            <ul>
                <li>Long pants tucked into treated white socks</li>
                <li>Long-sleeve treated shirt</li>
                <li>Hat or hood to protect scalp</li>
                <li>Picarikin repellent applied to exposed skin</li>
                <li>Removal tools accessible in backpack</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>During Trail Walking</h3>
        <p>Perform visual tick checks at rest points. The open meadows make ticks visible‚Äîcheck white socks frequently for dark specks.</p>

        <h3>Post-Hike Protocol</h3>
        <p>Shower within 2 hours of returning home. Perform full-body inspection. Wash treated clothing separately on high heat. Dry on high setting.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Olana-Specific Risk:</strong> The transition from open meadow to shaded forest is a tick "edge effect" hotspot. Maintain protective gear through all terrain changes despite varying apparent hazard levels.
