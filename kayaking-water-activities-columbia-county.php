         COLUMBIA COUNTY WATER LOCATIONS
         ======================================== -->
    <section id="locations">
        <h2>Best Water Activity Locations in Columbia County</h2>
        <p>Columbia County's location in the Hudson River Valley provides diverse water activity options suitable for families and beginners.</p>

        <h3>Thorne Lake (Ghent)</h3>
        <p>Peaceful freshwater lake approximately 1 mile long. Excellent for kayaking beginners and young children. Boat launch with parking, restroom facilities, and nearby picnic area. Calm water ideal for toddlers and nervous swimmers. Wildlife viewing opportunities‚Äîbald eagles, osprey, herons frequent this lake.</p>

        <h3>Hoff Pond (Austerlitz)</h3>
        <p>Small pond surrounded by forest. Scenic paddling with excellent fall foliage viewing. Limited development maintains natural conditions. Quieter than Thorne Lake with fewer crowds. Good for kids 6+ with moderate paddling experience.</p>

        <h3>Hudson River (Multiple Access Points)</h3>
        <p>The Hudson River offers opportunities for guided tours and experienced paddlers. Calm sections near Tivoli Bay and Red Hook suitable for families. Guided kayak tours often available through local outfitters during fall season.</p>

        <h3>Local Paddle Sports Outfitters</h3>
        <p>Multiple outfitters in Hudson and surrounding towns offer kayak rentals, guided tours, and lessons. Many specifically cater to families with kids. Outfitter staff can recommend locations based on child age and skill level.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Start with outfitter-guided tours rather than independent paddling. Guides provide safety instruction, lead you to best viewing areas, and manage pace for kids. Most family tours are 1‚Äì2 hours‚Äîperfect for young attention spans.

         WATER ACTIVITIES FOR KIDS
         ======================================== -->
    <section id="activities">
        <h2>Water Activities for Columbia County Kids</h2>
        <p>Beyond kayaking, Columbia County's water systems offer diverse activities.</p>

        <h3>Tandem Kayaking (Adult + Child)</h3>
        <p>Most suitable for kids ages 5‚Äì12 (with proper flotation). Child sits in front, adult paddles from behind for control. Builds confidence in nervous kids. Allows kids to enjoy paddling without independent skill requirements. Rentals typically available at major launch sites.</p>

        <h3>Single Kayaks (Experienced Kids)</h3>
        <p>Appropriate for kids 8+ with strong swimming ability and some paddling experience. Single kayaks are less stable than tandem but provide independence. Always supervise. Use calm, lake-based locations for early solo experience.</p>

        <h3>Paddleboards (All Ages)</h3>
        <p>Stand-up or sit-on paddleboards offer alternative to kayaking. More stable than kayaks, excellent for developing balance and strength. Appropriate for kids 4+ with adult supervision. Paddleboards cover greater distances and attract kids who find paddling boring.</p>

        <h3>Canoe Adventures (Tandem)</h3>
        <p>Traditional canoes can accommodate two adults plus child. More stable than kayaks. Better for groups. Slower pace and higher freeboard (side height) appeal to cautious paddlers.</p>

        <h3>Shoreline Exploration</h3>
        <p>Even without kayaking, shorelines provide excellent exploration. Stone skipping, wildlife watching, plant identification, and nature photography engage kids without requiring paddling skill.</p>

        <div class="strategy-box">
            <strong>Activity Strategy:</strong> Start with guided tours (instructor-led, all equipment provided). This introduces kids to paddling in safe environment. Progress to tandem kayaking once confidence builds. Reserve solo paddling for experienced, older kids. Always prioritize safety over advancing skill level.

         WATER SAFETY FUNDAMENTALS
         ======================================== -->
    <section id="safety">
        <h2>Water Safety for Kids</h2>
        <p>Water safety is paramount. These fundamentals prevent accidents and make water activities enjoyable.</p>

        <h3>Swimming Ability</h3>
        <p>Children should be able to swim at least 100 yards continuously and tread water for 1 minute before independent kayaking. Younger kids or non-swimmers should participate only in tandem craft with constant adult supervision. Swimming lessons are excellent preparation.</p>

        <h3>Personal Flotation Devices (PFDs)</h3>
        <p><strong>Mandatory:</strong> All children wear Coast Guard-approved PFDs at all times on water. PFDs must fit properly and be worn, not just carried. Even strong swimmers wear PFDs‚Äîmany pediatric drownings occur in PFDs worn incorrectly or not at all.</p>

        <h3>Supervision Ratio</h3>
        <p>For children under 12, maintain 1 adult per 2 children on water. For children under 6, maintain 1 adult per 1 child. Supervising adult should be strong swimmer capable of water rescue. Never rely on older siblings as primary supervisor.</p>

        <h3>Weather Awareness</h3>
        <p>Check weather forecast before departing. Wind (over 10mph) creates safety hazards for kayaks. Rain is acceptable, thunderstorms are not. Water temperature in October (50‚Äì55¬∞F) requires immediate exit if immersion occurs.</p>

        <h3>Pre-Launch Safety Check</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>All participants wear properly-fitted PFDs</li>
            <li>All participants know how to right overturned kayaks</li>
            <li>Emergency contact information provided to outfitter/supervisor</li>
            <li>Buddy system established‚Äîno one paddles alone</li>
            <li>Whistle or other sound signal available for emergency</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="warning">
            <strong>Water Temperature Alert:</strong> October water temperature in Columbia County is 50‚Äì55¬∞F. Immersion for more than 10 minutes causes cold-water shock and potential hypothermia. Rapid exit from water and warm clothing essential. This is primary reason many families choose fall outfitter-led tours rather than independent paddling.

    <!-- ========================================
         TICK PREVENTION FOR WATER ACTIVITIES
         ======================================== -->
    <section id="ticks">
        <h2>Tick Prevention Before, During & After Paddling</h2>
        <p>Ticks are not water hazards, but launch sites and parking areas often have high tick populations. Vehicle interiors and storage areas adjacent to launch sites harbor ticks.</p>

        <h3>Pre-Paddle (Parking Lot & Launch Area)</h3>
        <p>The highest tick risk is walking from parking to launch. Wear light-colored long pants, long sleeves, and closed-toe shoes. Apply permethrin to clothing 1‚Äì2 hours before arrival or wear permethrin-treated clothing. Tuck pants into socks. Most tick exposure happens in parking areas, not during actual paddling.</p>

        <h3>During Paddling</h3>
        <p>While on water in kayak, tick risk is minimal. However, if landing on shore or doing wet-land exploration, ticks are possible. Keep children in kayak and minimize shore contact. Paddling in open water 50+ feet from shore is tick-safe.</p>

        <h3>Post-Paddle (Recovery Area)</h3>
        <p>After paddling, walking from water back to vehicles/parking creates secondary tick exposure. Wear tick-prevention clothing during recovery phase. Change out of wet clothing in vehicle rather than exposing dry clothes to ground. Inspect children before entering vehicle.</p>

        <div class="warning">
            <strong>Vehicle Risk:</strong> Ticks can hitch rides in vehicles. Inspect children and yourself thoroughly before entering vehicle. Brush off any debris or vegetation. Check vehicle interior if you suspect tick exposure‚Äîthey can hide in car seats and remain viable for weeks.
        </div>

    <!-- ========================================
         AGE-APPROPRIATE PADDLING
         ======================================== -->
    <section id="ages">
        <h2>Age-Appropriate Water Activities</h2>

        <h3>Ages 2‚Äì4 (Toddlers)</h3>
        <p>Shoreline exploration and guided canoe rides for experienced paddlers only. Supervised wading in shallow water with constant adult contact. Water temperature requires wetsuits. Never independent water access. Emphasis on comfort and safety over paddling skills.</p>

        <h3>Ages 5‚Äì7 (Early Elementary)</h3>
        <p>Tandem kayaking with experienced adult is ideal. Front seat provides engagement without skill requirements. Guided group tours often include this age group. Single paddleboards may be appropriate with close supervision. Focus on enjoyment and confidence building.</p>

        <h3>Ages 8‚Äì10 (Elementary)</h3>
        <p>Tandem kayaking or single kayak paddling in calm water with adult supervision. Kids this age can learn basic paddling strokes. Paddleboards excellent for this age group. Outfitter-led group paddling works well. Strong swimmers can attempt longer paddles (30‚Äì45 minutes).</p>

        <h3>Ages 11+ (Older Kids)</h3>
        <p>Single kayak paddling in calm to moderate conditions. Capable of paddling 45+ minutes. Can handle landing/exit procedures. Older kids may enjoy photography, wildlife journal keeping, or navigation challenges during paddling. Some ready for more demanding conditions (mild currents, open water).</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Outfitter-led guided tours accommodate mixed-age groups. Guides adjust pace and route for abilities present. Tours are structured, safe, and eliminate planning burden. Most family tours cost $40‚Äì60 per person and last 1‚Äì2 hours.

    <!-- ========================================
         FALL PADDLE SEASON ADVANTAGES
         ======================================== -->
    <section id="fall">
        <h2>Why Fall is Perfect for Water Activities</h2>

        <h3>Foliage Display</h3>
        <p>Fall paddling offers unmatched scenery. Trees reflecting in calm water create stunning views. Kids understand seasonal change by witnessing foliage at water level. Autumn colors peak mid-October.</p>

        <h3>Moderate Temperatures</h3>
        <p>September water is warm (68‚Äì72¬∞F), reducing hypothermia risk. October water (55‚Äì60¬∞F) is cool but manageable with wetsuits. November water (45‚Äì50¬∞F) requires serious cold-water gear. Early fall offers ideal temperature window.</p>

        <h3>Calm Water Conditions</h3>
        <p>Summer and early fall winds are typically light. Water surfaces remain calm, ideal for beginners and young kids. Winter storm season creates more challenging conditions.</p>

        <h3>Fewer Crowds</h3>
        <p>Fall paddling lacks summer crowds. Outfitters often have openings for tours. Parking is easier. Water is less congested with recreational boaters.</p>
