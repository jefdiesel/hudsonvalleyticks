            <strong>üéØ Key Fact:</strong> You already own regular outdoor gear‚Äîhiking boots, pants, jackets. These don't have factory permethrin treatment. But they can.

        <p>With a permethrin spray, you can treat your existing clothes to provide tick protection comparable to specialty permethrin-treated apparel. This guide shows you exactly how to DIY-treat your clothes, plus answers to common questions about safety and effectiveness.</p>

        <h2>Why Treat Your Own Clothes?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cost-effective:</strong> Treat existing clothes instead of buying new ones</li>
            <li><strong>Versatile:</strong> Apply to any fabric‚Äîjeans, hiking pants, boots, hats, even backpacks</li>
            <li><strong>Effective:</strong> Same active ingredient as factory-treated clothing</li>
            <li><strong>Flexible:</strong> Treat clothes seasonally as needed</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- HOW IT WORKS -->
    <section class="section" tabindex="0" id="how-it-works">
        <h2>How Permethrin Spray Works</h2>
        <p>Permethrin spray works exactly like factory treatment. When sprayed on fabrics, it dries and bonds to the fibers. It kills ticks on contact and lasts through multiple washings (typically 5-6 washings depending on the product).</p>

        <h2>Step-by-Step: How to Treat Clothes with Permethrin</h2>

        <h3>What You'll Need</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Permethrin spray (Sawyer or similar brand)</li>
            <li>Outdoor space (garage, deck, yard)</li>
            <li>Clothes or gear to treat</li>
            <li>Hanger or laid flat</li>
            <li>30 minutes drying time</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 1: Choose Your Location</h3>
        <p>Spray outside‚Äîgarage, deck, or yard. You want good ventilation. Do not spray indoors.</p>

        <h3>Step 2: Hang or Lay Out Clothes</h3>
        <p>Hang items on a hanger or lay flat on a table. Make sure all surfaces are accessible.</p>

        <h3>Step 3: Spray Evenly</h3>
        <p>Following the bottle instructions, spray until the fabric is slightly wet but not soaking. Cover:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pants legs and waistband</li>
            <li>Shirt sleeves and front/back</li>
            <li>Socks and shoe uppers</li>
            <li>Hat brims and band</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 4: Let Dry Completely</h3>
        <p>Wait at least 4-6 hours (preferably overnight) before wearing. Full effectiveness requires drying time.</p>

        <h3>Step 5: Wait Before Washing</h3>
        <p>Don't wash treated clothes for at least 24 hours. This allows the permethrin to fully bond to the fibers.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>üí° Pro Tip:</strong> Treat clothes the day before a hiking trip. That way they're dry and ready when you head out.
