            <strong>🎯 Key Fact:</strong> The CDC recommends 30% DEET as the minimum concentration for effective tick protection. Not all DEET repellents are created equal.
        </div>

        <p>Ben's 30% DEET stands out as the gold standard—water-based, long-lasting, and proven effective in the field. This guide explains why 30% DEET works, how to use it safely, and why Ben's is the top choice for Hudson Valley hikers and outdoor enthusiasts.</p>

    <!-- WHY 30% DEET -->
    <section class="section" tabindex="0" id="why-deet">
        <h2>Why 30% DEET?</h2>
        <p>The percentage of DEET in a repellent doesn't determine how well it works—it determines how long it works. The CDC recommends:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>20-30% DEET:</strong> For light tick exposure (1-3 hours outdoors)</li>
            <li><strong>30-100% DEET:</strong> For extended exposure (all-day outdoor activities)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>30% DEET represents the sweet spot: effective for 12 hours, comfortable to apply, and doesn't require reapplication during most outdoor activities. Unlike 100% DEET, which can be overly strong and potentially irritating, 30% DEET provides serious protection without the drawbacks.</p>

    <section class="section" tabindex="0" id="water-vs-alcohol">
        <h2>Water-Based vs. Alcohol-Based DEET</h2>
        <p>Most traditional DEET repellents are alcohol-based. Ben's uses a water-based formula, which offers several advantages:</p>

        <table class="comparison-table">
            <tr>

    <section class="section" tabindex="0" id="how-to-apply">
        <h2>How to Apply Ben's 30% DEET</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Read the label:</strong> Follow instructions carefully</li>

            <li><strong>Spray exposed areas:</strong> Arms, legs, neck, and ears</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid face and eyes:</strong> Spray on hands first, then rub on face if needed</li>
