    <!-- SECTION 2: TRAIL DIFFICULTY & SKILLS -->
    <section id="difficulty">
        <h2>Trail Difficulty & Skill Levels</h2>
        <p>Bear Mountain offers multiple route options to accommodate different fitness and experience levels.</p>

        <h3>Easy Summit Route (5.5 miles, 2.5 hours)</h3>
        <p>Scenic walk via the Major Welch Trail to the summit. Minimal scrambling, well-maintained paths, and excellent for families. Elevation gain: 1,100 feet.</p>

        <h3>Moderate Loop (13 miles, 5-6 hours)</h3>
        <p>The classic Bear Mountain circuit combining the Appalachian Trail, Suffern-Bear Mountain Trail, and 1779 Trail. Rocky sections, stream crossings, and rewarding vistas. Recommended for fit hikers with trail experience. Elevation gain: 1,500 feet.</p>

        <h3>Challenging Loop (18+ miles, 8+ hours)</h3>
        <p>Extended circuit combining multiple trails through Harriman State Park. Technical terrain, stream navigation, and significant elevation change. For experienced hikers seeking serious adventure.</p>

        <div class="strategy-box">
            <strong>Choose Your Route Wisely:</strong> Start with the easy summit route to scout conditions. Many hikers do the moderate loop on their second visit once familiar with terrain.

    <section id="weather">

    <!-- SECTION 4: TICK PREVENTION STRATEGY -->
    <section id="tick-prevention">
        <h2>Integrated Tick Prevention for Bear Mountain Hiking</h2>
        <p>Bear Mountain crosses multiple habitat zones where ticks thrive. A multi-layered prevention approach is essential.</p>

        <h3>Clothing Protection: The First Line of Defense</h3>
        <div class="strategy-box">
            <strong>Three-Layer System:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Permethrin-treated long pants (tucked into white socks)</li>
                <li>Permethrin-treated long-sleeve shirt</li>
                <li>Hat or hood to prevent ticks on scalp</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Body Protection During the Hike</h3>
        <p>Reapply repellent to exposed skin every 2-3 hours. Picaridin or DEET provides protection on ankles, wrists, and neck.</p>

        <h3>Post-Hike Tick Check Protocol</h3>
        <p>Tick checks within 1-2 hours of returning home are critical. Follow CDC guidelines: shower, inspect entire body, wash treated clothing separately on high heat.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Critical Prevention Detail:</strong> Bear Mountain crosses areas frequented by white-tailed deer‚Äîprime tick habitat. Even brief exposures to tall grass create transmission risk. Wear treated clothing regardless of route difficulty.

    <!-- SECTION 6: DETAILED ROUTE & TIPS -->
    <section id="route-details">
        <h2>Detailed Route Guide & Insider Tips</h2>

        <h3>The 13-Mile Moderate Loop (Most Popular)</h3>
        <p><strong>Start:</strong> Bear Mountain parking lot | <strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 1,500 ft | <strong>Duration:</strong> 5-6 hours</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>0.0-2.5 mi:</strong> Major Welch Trail to summit (steady climb, excellent views at top)</li>
            <li><strong>2.5-5.5 mi:</strong> Descent via Appalachian Trail section (rocky, well-marked)</li>
            <li><strong>5.5-9.0 mi:</strong> Suffern-Bear Mountain Trail through evergreen forest (tick-prone area)</li>
            <li><strong>9.0-13.0 mi:</strong> Return via 1779 Trail and parking area</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Best Times to Hike</h3>
        <p>Weekday mornings (Tuesday-Thursday, 7-9am) offer solitude and safer tick conditions. Weekends draw crowds that can exceed 1,000+ hikers daily in peak season.</p>

        <h3>Water & Supplies</h3>
        <p>Carry 3+ liters of water. No reliable water sources on the main loop. Bring lunch‚Äîthere are no food vendors at the trailhead.</p>

        <h3>Restrooms & Facilities</h3>
        <p>Portable restrooms available at parking area (seasonal). Water fountains near visitor center. Plan ahead for restroom needs during the hike.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 7: SAFETY & EMERGENCY -->
    <section id="safety">
        <h2>Safety Considerations & Emergency Information</h2>

        <h3>Cell Service</h3>
        <p>Verizon and AT&T have decent coverage on summit and main trails. Service is spotty in valleys. Always tell someone your planned route and return time.</p>

        <h3>Hazards to Avoid</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stream crossings:</strong> Water levels high in spring‚Äîuse caution</li>
            <li><strong>Rock scrambles:</strong> Some areas have 15-20ft exposure‚Äînot technical but exposed</li>
            <li><strong>Deer ticks:</strong> The primary hazard in Hudson Valley. Use all prevention methods</li>
            <li><strong>Other wildlife:</strong> Deer, black bears (rare), and occasional rattlesnakes‚Äîobserve from distance</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Nearest Hospital</h3>
        <p><strong>Garnet Medical Center:</strong> Suffern, NY (15 minutes from trailhead)</p>
        <p>Lyme disease testing available. If you develop symptoms after hiking, mention tick exposure to your doctor.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 8: CLOSING RECOMMENDATIONS -->
    <section id="summary">
        <h2>Bear Mountain: The Perfect Hudson Valley Introduction</h2>
        <p>Bear Mountain offers accessible distance from NYC, variable difficulty levels, and stunning Hudson Valley scenery. The moderate 13-mile loop provides a full day of adventure while remaining achievable for fit recreational hikers.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Final Recommendation:</strong> Plan your first Bear Mountain hike for early morning in September or October. Weather is ideal, crowds are lighter than summer, and tick prevention can effectively manage autumn tick risk. Start with the 5-mile summit route, then return for the full loop once familiar with the terrain.
