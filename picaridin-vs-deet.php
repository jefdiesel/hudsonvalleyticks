    <h2>How Bug Repellents Work</h2>

    <p>Bug repellents don't kill insects like permethrin does. Instead, they make it harder for insects to find you. They mask your carbon dioxide signature or irritate the insect's sensory organs, causing it to fly or crawl away.</p>

    <p>Different repellent chemicals work differently, which is why effectiveness varies.</p>

<section class="section" tabindex="0" id="application">
    <h2>How to Apply Repellent Correctly</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Apply to exposed skin (arms, legs, neck)</li>
        <li>Apply to top of shoes and pant legs (ticks crawl up)</li>
        <li>Don't apply under clothing where ticks can hide</li>
        <li>Reapply after swimming or excessive sweating</li>
        <li>Use permethrin-treated clothing + Picarikin for best results</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="warning">
        <strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistake:</strong> Using bug spray alone without treating clothing. Bug spray doesn't kill ticks; it repels them. Ticks can still climb through untreated fabrics. Always combine repellent with permethrin-treated clothing.

    <h2>For Children and Pregnant Women</h2>

    <h3>Children 2 Months and Older</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Picarikin 10% is safe for children 2+ months</li>
        <li>DEET 10% is also safe for children 2+ months</li>
        <li>Never use on hands (they put hands in mouth)</li>
        <li>Apply to parent's hands, then rub on child</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Infants Under 2 Months</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Avoid repellents if possible</li>
        <li>Use protective clothing instead</li>
        <li>Keep them indoors during peak tick season if in high-risk areas</li>
    </ul>

<section class="section" tabindex="0" id="natural-alternatives">
    <h2>Natural Alternatives (Reality Check)</h2>

    <p>Oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), citronella, and other "natural" options are less effective. Oil of lemon eucalyptus has some effectiveness but requires more frequent reapplication.</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>üí° Pro Tip:</strong> "Natural" doesn't mean safer or better. The CDC recommends DEET and Picarikin because they're well-studied and effective‚Äînot because they're chemicals. Picarikin is actually derived from a natural compound found in pepper plants.

<section class="section" tabindex="0" id="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    
    <p>For Hudson Valley tick prevention, Picarikin 20% offers excellent protection, lasts longer than DEET, and feels better on skin. Combined with permethrin-treated clothing and regular tick checks, it's a solid part of your defense strategy.</p>
