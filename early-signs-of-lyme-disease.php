            <strong>üî¥ Critical Fact:</strong> Not everyone gets a bulls-eye rash. Studies show only 60-80% of Lyme disease patients develop the characteristic rash.
        </div>

        <p>You found a tick and removed it. Now you're waiting. What symptoms should you watch for? In the Hudson Valley, where Lyme disease is endemic, knowing what to look for in the first 3-30 days after a tick bite could be lifesaving. Early treatment with antibiotics is highly effective, but only if you recognize the symptoms.</p>

    <!-- TIMELINE -->
    <section class="section" tabindex="0" id="timeline">
        <h2>Timeline: When Lyme Symptoms Appear</h2>
        <p>Lyme disease symptoms don't appear immediately. Here's what the CDC tells us about timing:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>3-5 days:</strong> Earliest symptoms may begin (rash, fatigue)</li>
            <li><strong>7-14 days:</strong> Most common window for initial symptoms</li>
            <li><strong>3-30 days:</strong> Full range for early Lyme symptoms to appear</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="warning">
            <strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistake:</strong> Waiting weeks to see a doctor if you feel fine. Some people carry Lyme disease for months before seeking treatment, leading to more serious complications. If you were bitten and start experiencing ANY symptoms below, seek medical attention immediately‚Äîdon't wait.

    <!-- BULLSEYE RASH -->
    <section class="section" tabindex="0" id="bullseye-rash">
        <h2>The Bulls-Eye Rash (Erythema Migrans)</h2>
        <p>The bulls-eye rash is the most recognizable sign of Lyme disease, but it's important to know what it actually looks like:</p>

        <h3>What to Look For</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Location:</strong> Usually appears at or near the tick bite site</li>
            <li><strong>Shape:</strong> Red expanding ring with a clear center</li>
            <li><strong>Size:</strong> Starts small but expands outward (can reach 12 inches or larger)</li>
            <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> Appears within 3-30 days of infection</li>
            <li><strong>Feel:</strong> Usually flat, not raised or itchy</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>üí° Pro Tip:</strong> Not everyone gets a bulls-eye rash. So the absence of a rash does NOT mean you don't have Lyme disease. Watch for other symptoms!

    <!-- POST-LYME -->
    <section class="section" tabindex="0" id="post-lyme">
        <h2>Post-Lyme Disease Syndrome (PLDS)</h2>
        <p>Even with treatment, some people experience persistent symptoms weeks or months later. This is called Post-Lyme Disease Syndrome and may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Persistent fatigue</li>
            <li>Chronic joint pain</li>

    <!-- WHAT TO DO -->
    <section class="section" tabindex="0" id="what-to-do">
        <h2>What to Do If You Experience These Symptoms</h2>

        <h3>Step 1: Seek Medical Care</h3>
        <p>Contact your doctor or visit an urgent care facility. Tell them you were potentially exposed to ticks. Lyme disease is diagnosed through clinical presentation and blood tests (though early blood tests may be negative).</p>

        <h3>Step 2: Early Antibiotic Treatment</h3>
        <p>Early Lyme disease is highly treatable with antibiotics, typically doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime. Starting treatment within the first 30 days significantly reduces the risk of complications.</p>

        <h3>Step 3: Monitor Closely</h3>
        <p>Keep track of all symptoms and how they progress. Take photos of any rash. Document when symptoms started relative to the tick bite.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>üí° Pro Tip:</strong> Find a Lyme-fluent doctor in the Hudson Valley. Not all physicians are equally knowledgeable about tick-borne illness. The right doctor will take your symptoms seriously and provide appropriate treatment.
        </div>

    <!-- PREVENTION -->
    <section class="section" tabindex="0" id="prevention">
        <h2>Prevention: Your Best Defense</h2>
        <p>The best treatment for Lyme disease is prevention. Proper tick removal is critical for reducing infection risk:</p>
