        <h2>Why Your Pants Are Critical for Tick Prevention</h2>
        <p>You're heading out for a full day in the Hudson Valley‚Äîhiking, yard work, or just being outdoors. You know ticks are a risk. Your shirt has permethrin treatment. Your socks are white and protected. But what about your legs?</p>
        <p>Your legs are a prime target for ticks. They're exposed as you move through brush and tall grass. If you're serious about tick prevention, your pants matter.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>üí° Pro Tip:</strong> Permethrin-treated pants are your passive defense layer. Even if a tick contacts your clothing, it dies before it can explore further.

        <h2>The Tick's Perspective</h2>
        <p>Ticks crawl from the ground up. They encounter your legs and lower body before anything else. Unprotected pants mean ticks can crawl across your legs for minutes before reaching bare skin‚Äîgiving them time to find a good attachment spot.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Tick touches unprotected pants leg</li>
            <li>Tick crawls across fabric looking for a gap</li>
            <li>Tick finds the hem, ankle, or waistband</li>
            <li>Tick crawls onto skin and attaches</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>vs. With Permethrin-treated pants:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tick touches treated fabric</li>
            <li>Tick dies on contact within seconds</li>
            <li>You're protected</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Fabric Requirements</h3>
        <ul>

        <h2>How Ripstop Fabric Helps with Ticks</h2>

        <p>Ripstop fabric is designed to tear-resist‚Äîbut for tick prevention, the benefit goes deeper:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tight weave:</strong> Makes it harder for ticks to cling and climb</li>
            <li><strong>Smooth surface:</strong> Ticks can't grip as easily</li>
            <li><strong>Durability:</strong> The pants last through multiple seasons, so the permethrin treatment is a long-term investment</li>
            <li><strong>Breathability:</strong> Unlike heavy canvas, ripstop allows air circulation</li>
        </ul>
