        <h2>Why Complete Kits Work</h2>

        <p>Complete protection addresses vulnerabilities that piecemeal approaches miss:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hat:</strong> Ticks climb onto scalp and hairline</li>
            <li><strong>Belt:</strong> Covers waist area where pants meet shirt (common attachment point)</li>
            <li><strong>Leg Gaiters:</strong> Stops ticks at ankle level</li>
            <li><strong>Arm Cuffs:</strong> Protects wrists and inner arms</li>
            <li><strong>Bandana:</strong> Protects neck and lower face</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Together, these pieces eliminate most tick entry points to your body.</p>
