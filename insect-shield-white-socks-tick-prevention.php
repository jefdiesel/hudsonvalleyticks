        <h2>Why White Socks? Visibility = Early Detection</h2>
        <p>Here's a question that seems simple but has a surprisingly powerful answer: What color should your hiking socks be? If you want maximum tick protection, the answer is WHITE.</p>
        <p>Ticks are tiny‚Äîespecially the dangerous nymph-stage blacklegged ticks that transmit Lyme disease. When a tick crawls onto your leg, you often won't feel it. But on white socks? You'll see it immediately.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section" tabindex="0" id="visibility">
        <h2>The Visibility Advantage</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Black sock:</strong> Tick blends in, you don't notice</li>
            <li><strong>White sock:</strong> Dark tick stands out immediately against white background</li>
            <li><strong>Time to removal:</strong> On white socks, you catch the tick within seconds or minutes</li>
            <li><strong>Lyme transmission prevention:</strong> Quick removal before 24 hours minimizes Lyme transmission risk</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>üí° Pro Tip:</strong> Wearing white socks turns your legs into a tick detection system. You'll see crawling ticks before they attach.

        <h2>Permethrin Treatment: Double Protection</h2>

        <p>White socks are better for visibility, but permethrin-treated white socks give you TWO layers of protection:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Visibility layer:</strong> You see ticks immediately on white fabric</li>
            <li><strong>Kill layer:</strong> Permethrin kills any tick that contacts the sock fabric</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Together, these create an extremely effective barrier at your ankles and lower legs‚Äîexactly where ticks try to attach.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section" tabindex="0" id="tick-behavior">
        <h2>Why Ticks Climb Your Legs First</h2>

        <p>Ticks don't jump or fly. They crawl from the ground up. The first place they encounter is your feet and ankles. If you're wearing permethrin-treated white socks, ticks die on contact before they ever reach your skin.</p>

        <h3>The Tick's Path</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Tick waits in grass/brush</li>
            <li>You brush past</li>
            <li>Tick crawls onto your shoe/sock</li>
            <li>Tick encounters permethrin and dies (or you see it and brush it off)</li>
            <li>Tick never reaches bare skin</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Wearing White Socks Correctly</h2>

        <h3>Do This</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Tuck pant legs into white socks</li>
            <li>Keep socks pulled up above ankle</li>
            <li>Check frequently while hiking (tick checks every hour or so)</li>
            <li>Look for moving dark spots</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Don't Do This</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Wear white socks with bare ankles exposed</li>
            <li>Let pant legs drape over socks</li>
            <li>Forget to actually look at your socks</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>üí° Pro Tip:</strong> The "tuck pants into socks" look feels goofy, but it's a proven tick prevention strategy. Looks don't matter if you're Lyme disease-free.
