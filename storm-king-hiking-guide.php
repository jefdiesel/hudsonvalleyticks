    <!-- SECTION 1: ACCESSIBILITY FROM NYC -->
    <section id="accessibility">
        <h2>Getting to Storm King from NYC</h2>
        <p>Storm King is strategically located for NYC day-trippers. Metro-North provides direct train access, making it ideal for those without cars or preferring eco-friendly transit.</p>

        <p>Grand Central Terminal ‚Üí Cornwall-on-Hudson Station on Hudson Line. Exit the station and follow signs to Storm King Mountain parking and trailhead. This is the most convenient NYC access in the entire Hudson Valley.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Trains depart every 30-60 minutes on weekdays</li>
            <li>Weekend service: every 60-90 minutes</li>

            <li>15-minute walk from station to trailhead</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>üöó Driving from NYC</h3>
        <p><strong>Distance:</strong> 45 miles | <strong>Drive Time:</strong> 60-75 minutes</p>
        <p>Take Hudson River Parkway north through Westchester County. Cross into Rockland County at the Tappan Zee Bridge. Continue north on Route 9W to Cornwall-on-Hudson. Parking available at Storm King parking lot ($10 for day-use).</p>
        <ul>

        </ul>

        <h3>Tick Prevention During Travel</h3>
        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Change into full permethrin-treated hiking gear BEFORE leaving the train station or parking lot. Storm King has significant tick habitat. Don't walk in regular clothes to reach the trailhead.
        </div>

    <!-- SECTION 2: TRAIL DIFFICULTY & SKILLS -->
    <section id="difficulty">
        <h2>Trail Difficulty & Route Options</h2>
        <p>Storm King offers multiple loop options from easy 3-mile valley walks to challenging 7-mile ridge circuits.</p>

        <h3>Easy Valley Walk (3 miles, 1.5 hours)</h3>
        <p>Scenic walk through Storm King Mountain State Historic Site lower trails. Forest walking, minimal elevation gain. Ideal for families or recovery hikes. Tick risk: Moderate (shaded forest habitat).</p>

        <h3>Moderate Summit Loop (5 miles, 2.5-3 hours)</h3>
        <p>Most popular route. Ascending via Scenic Trail to summit, return via Tower Trail. Sustained climb with excellent views at top. Elevation gain: 800 feet. Recommended for hikers with basic fitness. Tick risk: High (mixed forest and scrub).</p>

        <h3>Challenging Ridge Loop (7 miles, 4-5 hours)</h3>
        <p>Extended circuit including Ice Caves Mountain and additional ridgelines. Technical scrambling, significant elevation changes, and panoramic vistas. For experienced hikers seeking solitude. Elevation gain: 1,200 feet. Tick risk: Very High (prime deer habitat).</p>

        <div class="strategy-box">
            <strong>First-Time Recommendation:</strong> Start with the moderate summit loop. It provides the essential Storm King experience‚Äîdramatic river views with manageable difficulty. Advance to the ridge loop once familiar with terrain.

    <!-- SECTION 3: SEASONAL WEATHER & CONDITIONS -->
    <section id="weather">
        <h2>Seasonal Weather Patterns & Hiking Conditions</h2>

        <h3>Spring (April-May): Muddy Season üå∏</h3>
        <p><strong>Temperature:</strong> 45-60¬∞F | <strong>Tick Risk:</strong> Moderate</p>
        <p>Recent snowmelt creates wet, muddy trails. Stream crossings are full. Muddy conditions make traction difficult on rocky sections. Nymph ticks emerge late April. Consider waiting until mid-May for drier conditions.</p>

        <h3>Summer (June-August): Hot & Crowded ‚òÄÔ∏è</h3>
        <p><strong>Temperature:</strong> 75-88¬∞F | <strong>Tick Risk:</strong> Very High</p>
        <p>Clear skies and warm weather attract massive crowds. Weekends can have 500+ hikers. Peak tick season‚Äînymphs and adults highly active. Start early (6-7am) to avoid crowds and afternoon heat.</p>

        <h3>Fall (September-November): Prime Season üçÇ</h3>
        <p><strong>Temperature:</strong> 50-70¬∞F | <strong>Tick Risk:</strong> High</p>
        <p>Optimal hiking conditions. Fall foliage creates stunning Hudson River backdrops. October brings adult tick emergence. September offers the best balance of weather and tick risk.</p>

        <h3>Winter (December-March): Quiet & Icy ‚ùÑÔ∏è</h3>
        <p><strong>Temperature:</strong> 25-45¬∞F | <strong>Tick Risk:</strong> Low</p>
        <p>Few people on trails. Bare trees reveal Hudson River views. Ice and snow create hazards on steep sections. Microspikes essential for safety.</p>

        <div class="warning">
            <strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Weather Note:</strong> Hudson River valley creates wind tunnels. Summit wind speeds can be 10-20mph faster than forecasted. Dress in layers and carry windproof jacket.

    <!-- SECTION 4: TICK PREVENTION STRATEGY -->
    <section id="tick-prevention">
        <h2>Storm King Tick Prevention: Strategic Approach</h2>
        <p>Storm King crosses habitat types from open ridge to dense forest‚Äîall prime tick zones. This requires comprehensive multi-layered protection.</p>

        <h3>Pre-Hike Preparation</h3>
        <div class="strategy-box">
            <ul>
                <li>Tuck long pants into white permethrin-treated socks</li>
                <li>Wear long-sleeve permethrin-treated shirt</li>
                <li>Apply picarikin repellent to wrists, ankles, and neck</li>
                <li>Carry removal tool in pack pocket</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>During the Hike</h3>
        <p>Reapply picarikin every 2 hours to exposed skin. Perform visual tick checks at summit and halfway points. Look for dark specks on white socks‚Äîticks are highly visible against white fabric.</p>

        <h3>Post-Hike Protocol</h3>
        <p>Upon returning from Storm King, shower within 2 hours. Inspect entire body, especially hairline, behind ears, armpits, and groin. Wash treated clothing on high heat (60+ degrees) and dry on high setting.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Storm King Specific Risk:</strong> Open ridge sections at summit appear "safe" but harbor nymphal ticks in scrub vegetation. Don't be fooled by scenic vistas‚Äîmaintain full protective gear throughout the hike.

    <!-- SECTION 6: DETAILED ROUTE GUIDE -->
    <section id="route-details">
        <h2>Detailed Route Guide: Moderate Summit Loop</h2>

        <h3>Route Summary: 5 Miles, 2.5-3 Hours, 800ft Elevation Gain</h3>
        <p><strong>Start:</strong> Storm King Mountain State Historic Site parking lot</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>0.0-1.5 mi:</strong> Scenic Trail ascent through hardwood forest (steady climb, 500ft gain)</li>
            <li><strong>1.5-2.0 mi:</strong> Summit plateau and observation tower area (spectacular Hudson River views)</li>
            <li><strong>2.0-3.5 mi:</strong> Tower Trail descent through dense forest (rocky, technical downhill)</li>
            <li><strong>3.5-5.0 mi:</strong> Forest Valley Trail return to parking (gentle finish)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Key Waypoints & Landmarks</h3>
        <p><strong>Mile 1.5 (Summit):</strong> Observation tower with 360-degree Hudson Valley views. Rest point and tick check recommended. Water not available‚Äîbring all needed supplies.</p>
        <p><strong>Mile 3.5 (Valley Junction):</strong> Trail intersection where Tower Trail meets Forest Valley Trail. Choose correct descending fork to avoid getting lost.</p>

        <h3>Best Times to Hike Storm King</h3>
        <p>Weekday mornings (8-10am) offer optimal conditions: fewer crowds, cooler temperatures, and lower tick pressure. Weekends from June-September see 300-500+ hikers daily. Plan weekday hikes during peak season.</p>

        <h3>Water & Supplies</h3>

    <section id="safety">
        <h2>Safety Considerations & Emergency Information</h2>

        <h3>Cell Service</h3>
        <p>Verizon coverage is good on ridges. AT&T has spotty coverage in valleys. Always tell someone your planned route and expected return time before leaving parking lot.</p>

        <h3>Hazards to Be Aware Of</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Steep drop-offs:</strong> Tower Trail has unprotected 15-20ft drops on both sides‚Äîstay on marked path</li>
            <li><strong>Rocky scrambles:</strong> Technical rocky terrain on descent requires attention</li>
            <li><strong>Ticks:</strong> Primary hazard. Comprehensive prevention essential despite dramatic summit views</li>
            <li><strong>Wind:</strong> Summit can be gusty and cold. Bring windproof layer</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Nearest Hospitals</h3>
        <p><strong>Cornwall Hospital:</strong> 5 minutes from trailhead. Full Lyme disease testing and treatment available.</p>
        <p>Mention tick exposure immediately if you develop symptoms within 30 days of hiking.</p>
