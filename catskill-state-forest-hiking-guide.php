    <!-- SECTION 1: ACCESSIBILITY FROM NYC -->
    <section id="accessibility">
        <h2>Getting to Catskill State Forest from NYC</h2>
        <p>Catskill State Forest offers genuine wilderness with reasonable NYC access. Multiple trailheads provide flexibility.</p>

        <h3>üöó Driving to Main Trailheads</h3>
        <p><strong>Distance:</strong> 105 miles | <strong>Drive Time:</strong> 2.5-3 hours from Manhattan</p>
        <p>Route 9 north to Claryville, NY area. Follow signs to state forest. Multiple trailhead parking areas available ($5-10 per vehicle or free). Parking rarely fills.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Google Maps: "Catskill State Forest Claryville"</li>
            <li>Multiple access points</li>
            <li>Scenic forest drive approaching trailhead</li>
            <li>Parking generally abundant</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>üèïÔ∏è Camping & Extended Stays</h3>
        <p>Lean-to shelters and primitive camping available throughout forest. Permits required. Enables multi-day backpacking in protected wilderness. Check NY DEC website for regulations.</p>

        <h3>Backcountry Preparation</h3>
        <p>State forest is genuine wilderness. Cell service unreliable. Water from streams requires treatment. Navigation skills essential. Tell someone your planned route before departing.</p>

        <h3>Tick Prevention for Deep Wilderness</h3>
        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Remote Trail Exposure:</strong> Deep forest environment maximizes tick habitat exposure. Extended time in wilderness increases risk exponentially. Pack multiple repellent bottles, extra removal tools, and expect to find ticks during hike.
        </div>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 2: TRAIL DIFFICULTY & SKILLS -->
    <section id="difficulty">
        <h2>Trail Difficulty & Route Options</h2>
        <p>Catskill State Forest offers routes spanning moderate to challenging terrain.</p>

        <h3>Moderate Mountain Loop (6-7 miles, 3-4 hours)</h3>
        <p>Sustained climb to forest peaks. Elevation gain 1,000-1,200 feet. Well-maintained trail. Forest views rather than dramatic vista. Appropriate for fit recreational hikers. Tick risk: High (full forest exposure).</p>

        <h3>Extended Peak Circuit (8-10 miles, 4-5 hours)</h3>
        <p>Multiple peaks with greater elevation change. Technical footing in some sections. More remote atmosphere. For experienced hikers comfortable with wilderness. Elevation gain: 1,500-1,800 feet. Tick risk: Very High.</p>

        <h3>Backcountry Multi-Day (12+ miles, 2-3 days)</h3>
        <p>Complete forest traversal with camping. Requires backcountry skills, permits, bear-bag knowledge. Extreme tick exposure from extended forest time. Only for experienced wilderness hikers.</p>

        <div class="warning">
            <strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Wilderness Reality:</strong> Catskill State Forest is genuine wilderness. Not maintained to day-hike level. Requires navigation, water treatment, and comfort with uncertainty. Not recommended for beginners.
        </div>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 3: SEASONAL WEATHER & CONDITIONS -->
    <section id="weather">
        <h2>Seasonal Weather Patterns & Forest Conditions</h2>

        <h3>Spring (April-May): Muddy & Wet üå∏</h3>
        <p><strong>Temperature:</strong> 45-60¬∞F | <strong>Tick Risk:</strong> Moderate | <strong>Stream Levels:</strong> High</p>
        <p>Muddy trails from snowmelt. Streams flowing heavily. Nymph ticks emerging late April. Not ideal for early spring hiking.</p>

        <h3>Summer (June-August): Warm & Buggy ‚òÄÔ∏è</h3>
        <p><strong>Temperature:</strong> 70-80¬∞F | <strong>Tick Risk:</strong> Extreme | <strong>Humidity:</strong> High</p>
        <p>Peak tick season in forest environment. Humidity increases insect pressure. Deep forest canopy stays relatively cool. July-August can be oppressive with bugs. Start early (6am) to beat heat and crowds.</p>

        <h3>Fall (September-November): Optimal Season üçÇ</h3>
        <p><strong>Temperature:</strong> 50-70¬∞F | <strong>Tick Risk:</strong> Very High | <strong>Foliage:</strong> Exceptional</p>
        <p>Best conditions with clear skies and comfortable temps. September ideal for tick-weather balance. October brings adult ticks. Spectacular fall colors through forest. Fewer crowds than summer.</p>

        <h3>Winter (December-March): Challenging ‚ùÑÔ∏è</h3>
        <p><strong>Temperature:</strong> 20-35¬∞F | <strong>Tick Risk:</strong> Low | <strong>Conditions:</strong> Snow/ice</p>
        <p>Snow and ice create serious hazards on maintained trails. Microspikes essential. Only experienced winter hikers. Reduced tick season makes it less attractive despite challenging conditions.</p>

        <div class="warning">
            <strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Forest Weather:</strong> Deep forest creates microclimates. Conditions differ dramatically from open ridges. Fog/clouds can reduce visibility. Weather changes rapidly. Check forecast before committing.

    <!-- SECTION 4: TICK PREVENTION STRATEGY -->
    <section id="tick-prevention">
        <h2>Catskill State Forest Tick Prevention: Deep Forest Risk</h2>
        <p>Deep forest environment is prime tick habitat. Extended time surrounded by trees multiplies exposure. Comprehensive prevention essential.</p>

        <h3>Pre-Hike Preparation</h3>
        <div class="strategy-box">
            <ul>
                <li>FULL permethrin-treated outfit required</li>
                <li>Long pants tucked into treated white socks</li>
                <li>Long-sleeve shirt treated</li>
                <li>Hat protecting scalp and hairline</li>
                <li>Heavy-duty work gloves for brush</li>
                <li>Multiple repellent bottles (2+ large)</li>
                <li>Premium removal kit with magnifier</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>During Extended Forest Hiking</h3>
        <p>Reapply repellent every 1-2 hours. Perform tick checks every 1.5 hours on schedule‚Äîdon't wait for symptoms. Many hikers experience tick anxiety in deep forest; this is appropriate and normal. Immediately remove any found ticks.</p>

        <h3>Post-Hike Protocol</h3>
        <p>Shower immediately (within 1 hour ideally). Thorough full-body inspection‚Äîdeep forest time means more tick exposure. Inspect especially hairline, behind ears, groin, armpits. Wash clothes separately on high heat. Dry on high setting. Consider separate wash cycle for full load of hiking clothes.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Forest Tick Realism:</strong> Many hikers remove dozens of ticks during post-hike inspection after Catskill State Forest hikes. This is completely normal and expected. Proper prevention reduces transmission risk but doesn't prevent encounters. Psychological preparation helpful.

    <!-- SECTION 6: DETAILED ROUTE GUIDE -->
    <section id="route-details">
        <h2>Detailed Route Guide: Moderate Mountain Loop</h2>

        <h3>Route Summary: 8 Miles, 4-5 Hours, 1,500ft Elevation</h3>
        <p><strong>Start:</strong> Main state forest parking area</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>0.0-1.5 mi:</strong> Initial climb through hardwood forest (steady elevation gain)</li>
            <li><strong>1.5-3.5 mi:</strong> Sustained mountain ascent (steeper section)</li>
            <li><strong>3.5-4.0 mi:</strong> Forest peak with limited views (mature forest)</li>
            <li><strong>4.0-6.5 mi:</strong> Descent via alternate trail (technical footing)</li>
            <li><strong>6.5-8.0 mi:</strong> Return through lower forest to parking</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Trail Character</h3>
        <p>Primarily under forest canopy. Old-growth sections with massive trees. Few clearings or dramatic vistas. Trail experience is about forest immersion rather than views. Primitive feel but maintained to hiking standard.</p>

        <h3>Water & Supplies</h3>
        <p>Stream at mile 2.0 (water needs treatment). Otherwise carry all water (4+ liters minimum). No facilities on trail. Pack substantial lunch.</p>

        <h3>Navigation</h3>
        <p>Trail is marked but requires attention. Topographic map and compass recommended. Smartphone GPS backup. Do not attempt without navigation tools.</p>

        <h3>Best Times</h3>
        <p>Early September weekday mornings offer optimal conditions. Depart 6am for summit by 10am and return by 2pm. Expect to find multiple ticks during post-hike inspection.</p>

    <section id="ecology">
        <h2>Catskill State Forest: Ecological Significance</h2>

        <h3>Forest Type & Composition</h3>
