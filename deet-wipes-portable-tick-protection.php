    <section class="section" tabindex="0" id="why-wipes">
        <h2>Why DEET Wipes Are Game-Changers</h2>
        <p>Traditional DEET sprays have drawbacks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Liquids leak in backpacks and luggage</li>
            <li>Aerosol cans aren't TSA-approved for air travel</li>
            <li>Spraying is messy and can get on gear</li>
            <li>Hard to apply evenly to face and neck</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Ben's DEET wipes eliminate these issues while delivering the same powerful 30% DEET protection.</p>

        <h2>How to Use DEET Wipes</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Open individual wrapper</li>
            <li>Wipe exposed skin (arms, legs, neck, ears)</li>
            <li>Make sure to wipe like you're cleaning—rub thoroughly</li>
            <li>One wipe can cover entire exposed body if done carefully</li>
            <li>Wash hands after application (don't touch face/eyes)</li>
            <li>Allow to dry before getting dressed</li>
            <li>For air travel, fold the open wrapper to keep unused portion moist for later use</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>💡 Pro Tip:</strong> One wipe covers your arms, legs, neck and face if you work carefully. Two wipes is ideal for very thorough coverage. With 24 wipes, you can protect yourself for multiple outdoor trips.
