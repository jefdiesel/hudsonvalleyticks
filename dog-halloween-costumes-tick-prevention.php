        <h2>Trick-or-Treating with Your Dog: Stay Adorable, Stay Safe</h2>
        
        <p>Your dog in a Halloween costume is absolutely adorable. Whether it's a pumpkin costume, a superhero outfit, or a funny pair of costumes coordinated with yours, dressed-up dogs delight everyone during Halloween celebrations.</p>
        
        <p>But here's the challenge: October is peak tick season in Hudson Valley, and your dog is even more susceptible to ticks than you are. Dogs contract Lyme disease at rates 10x higher than humans in endemic areas. While you're enjoying the costume cuteness, ticks are looking for a way to attach to your dog.</p>
        
        <div class="featured-section">
            <strong>Critical Consideration:</strong> Many dog costumes completely obscure your ability to do regular tick checks. A thick costume makes it impossible to see if ticks are crawling on your dog's fur. This is why strategic costume choices and preventative treatment are essential.
        </div>
        
        <p>This guide shows you how to choose dog Halloween costumes that are both adorable and safe, maintain your dog's tick prevention, and keep tick-checking possible while your pup is in costume.</p>

    <!-- SECTION 1: DOG COSTUME SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS -->
    <section class="section" id="costume-safety">
        <h2>Costume Safety First: What Every Dog Owner Should Know</h2>
        
        <h3>Why Costume Fit Matters</h3>
        
        <p>Before we even discuss ticks, let's talk about costume safety. A poorly fitting costume can:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Restrict movement and cause injury</li>
            <li>Trap heat and cause overheating</li>
            <li>Cause choking if not properly fitted</li>
            <li>Create stress and anxiety in your dog</li>
            <li>Hide injuries or prevent you from spotting health issues</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>A good dog Halloween costume is snug but not tight, allows full movement, and doesn't cover the face or restrict the mouth (so your dog can pant). The costume should be easy to remove quickly if your dog becomes stressed.</p>
        
        <h3>Tick Prevention and Costumes</h3>
        
        <p>Here's the tick issue: if your dog is wearing a thick costume, you can't see their skin to check for ticks. Ticks can hide under costume material. If your dog scratches at their costume, they might be trying to remove a tick, not just discomfort from the outfit.</p>
        
        <p>Solution: Choose lighter costumes that allow visibility of your dog's fur, or plan very frequent tick checks even while your dog is costumed.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 2: COSTUME IDEAS THAT ALLOW TICK CHECKS -->
    <section class="section" id="costume-ideas">
        <h2>Dog Halloween Costume Ideas That Work with Tick Prevention</h2>
        
        <h3>Light, Visible Costumes (Best for Tick Prevention)</h3>
        
        <p><strong>Bandana or Collar Costumes:</strong> Add a themed bandana around your dog's neck (pumpkin print, spider web, ghost faces) or a festive collar. These are barely noticeable from a tick prevention perspective and allow full visibility of your dog's body. The bandana is easy to remove for tick checks.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Vest-Style Costumes:</strong> Lightweight vests that fit over your dog's back without restricting movement. These cover the most visible area (where owners look most often) while keeping the dog's sides and chest visible for tick checks. Think Halloween-themed vests or superhero capes.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Hat or Headpiece Costumes:</strong> Put a small hat, crown, or antlers on your dog's head. These are adorable, completely non-restrictive, and keep your dog's entire body visible for tick monitoring. Think pumpkin head, reindeer ears, or a witch hat.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Bow Tie or Formal Collar Costumes:</strong> Dress your dog up as a fancy guest with a large bow tie or formal collar. This is minimalist costume fashion that's perfect for tick prevention.</p>
        
        <h3>Full-Coverage Costumes That Allow Tick Checks (Second-Best Option)</h3>
        
        <p>If you want a full-coverage costume for your dog, choose ones that are:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Loose-fitting:</strong> Don't choose costumes that are skin-tight. Your dog needs to move freely and you need to be able to slip your hand underneath to feel for ticks</li>
            <li><strong>See-through panels:</strong> Some costumes have mesh or see-through sections where you can see your dog's fur</li>
            <li><strong>Removable in sections:</strong> Choose costumes where you can roll up the sleeves or remove legs one at a time to check for ticks</li>
            <li><strong>Quick to remove:</strong> Avoid costumes with many buttons, snaps, or complex closures. You need to be able to remove it quickly if your dog is stressed or if you spot a tick</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Costumes to Avoid</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Skin-tight costumes that prevent you from feeling your dog's body</li>
            <li>Costumes that cover your dog's face or mouth (safety hazard and prevents panting)</li>
            <li>Heavy, thick costumes that could cause overheating</li>
            <li>Costumes with small parts your dog could chew off and choke on</li>
            <li>Any costume your dog shows fear or anxiety about</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- SECTION 3: TICK PREVENTION + HALLOWEEN STRATEGY FOR DOGS -->
    <section class="section" id="prevention">
        <h2>Complete Tick Prevention Strategy for Halloween Dogs</h2>
        
        <h3>Before Halloween Night</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Confirm tick prevention is active:</strong> Make sure your dog's monthly tick preventative (Simparica, Bravecto, etc.) is current. If using a collar, verify it's properly fitted. Don't let Halloween prevent you from maintaining prevention</li>
            <li><strong>Plan costume fit:</strong> Ensure the costume is loose enough that you can slip your hand underneath to feel for ticks</li>
            <li><strong>Do a practice run:</strong> Have your dog wear the costume at home for 30 minutes before Halloween to ensure they're comfortable</li>
            <li><strong>Set tick-check schedule:</strong> Plan to check your dog for ticks every 15-30 minutes while in costume (more frequently than usual)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>During Halloween</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Frequent tick checks:</strong> Every 15-30 minutes, briefly remove your dog's costume and do a quick tick inspection. Look at neck, behind ears, between toes, groin area, and belly</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid high-tick areas:</strong> Skip visiting yards with tall grass, dense brush, or wooded areas if possible. Stick to well-maintained neighborhoods for trick-or-treating</li>
            <li><strong>Watch for scratching:</strong> If your dog excessively scratches at the costume, remove it immediately and check for ticks. Don't assume scratching is just costume discomfort</li>
            <li><strong>Limit duration:</strong> Consider a shorter trick-or-treating session (30-60 minutes) rather than hours of exposure. Your dog can go with you partway, then stay home with a caregiver</li>
            <li><strong>Keep costume removable:</strong> Never be in a situation where you can't quickly remove your dog's costume if needed</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>After Halloween</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Immediate tick check:</strong> As soon as you get home, remove the costume and do a thorough full-body tick inspection</li>
            <li><strong>Pay special attention to:</strong> Ears, between toes, neck, armpits, groin, belly, and back legs</li>
            <li><strong>Remove any ticks:</strong> Use fine-tipped tweezers to grasp the tick at the skin surface and pull straight out. Don't twist or crush the tick body</li>
            <li><strong>Consider medicated shampoo:</strong> If you found multiple ticks or want extra assurance, use a medicated flea and tick shampoo that evening</li>
            <li><strong>Monitor for days:</strong> Watch your dog over the next 2-4 weeks for any signs of Lyme disease: fever, lameness, lethargy, loss of appetite, or joint swelling</li>
        </ul>
