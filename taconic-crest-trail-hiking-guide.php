    <!-- SECTION 1: ACCESSIBILITY FROM NYC -->
    <section id="accessibility">
        <h2>Getting to Taconic Crest Trail from NYC</h2>
        <p>Taconic Crest offers remote wilderness despite reasonable driving distance from Manhattan. Multiple trailhead access points accommodate different hike plans.</p>

        <h3>üöó Driving to Northern Trailhead (Bash Bish Falls)</h3>
        <p><strong>Distance:</strong> 110 miles | <strong>Drive Time:</strong> 2.5-3 hours from Manhattan</p>
        <p>Drive north to Massachusetts border. Access via Great Barrington, MA or Copake, NY. Parking at Bash Bish Falls parking area ($5-10). Popular starting point for south-to-north ridge traverses.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Google Maps: "Bash Bish Falls State Park"</li>
            <li>Scenic drive through rural Columbia County</li>
            <li>Multiple access points along ridge</li>
            <li>Trailhead parking fills weekends‚Äîarrive early</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>üöó Driving to Southern Trailhead (Harlem Valley)</h3>
        <p><strong>Distance:</strong> 100 miles | <strong>Drive Time:</strong> 2-2.5 hours from Manhattan</p>
        <p>Route 9 north to Millerton, NY area. Southern trailhead access near Harlem Valley. Smaller parking area suitable for quieter experience.</p>

        <h3>üèïÔ∏è Primitive Camping Option</h3>
        <p>Taconic Crest offers designated primitive camping. Requires permit (check NY DEC website). Multi-day backpacking possible with proper preparation and tick prevention gear.</p>

        <h3>Tick Prevention for Long-Distance Hiking</h3>
        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Extended Exposure Strategy:</strong> Long-distance hiking increases tick exposure risk exponentially. Pack extra treated clothing, multiple repellent bottles, and removal tools. Plan frequent tick checks (every 2 hours minimum).
        </div>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 2: TRAIL DIFFICULTY & SKILLS -->
    <section id="difficulty">
        <h2>Trail Difficulty & Route Options</h2>
        <p>Taconic Crest is exclusively challenging terrain. No easy options exist on this ridge.</p>

        <h3>Day Hike Section (8-10 miles, 5-6 hours)</h3>
        <p>Northern or southern ridge sections. Sustained elevation changes. Elevation gain: 1,500-2,000 feet. Requires solid hiking fitness and scrambling comfort. Tick risk: Very High (ridge scrub habitat).</p>

        <h3>Extended Day Hike (12+ miles, 7-8 hours)</h3>
        <p>Multiple ridge sections combining views and challenge. For experienced hikers comfortable with all-day effort. Elevation gain: 2,500+ feet. Tick risk: Extreme (long exposure to tick habitat).</p>

        <h3>Multi-Day Backpacking (20+ miles, 2-3 days)</h3>
        <p>Complete ridge traversal with primitive camping. Requires backcountry experience, permits, and bear-bag knowledge. Extreme tick exposure. Not recommended except for experienced backpackers.</p>

        <div class="warning">
            <strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Warning:</strong> Taconic Crest is SERIOUS wilderness with significant elevation, weather exposure, and NO cell service in many sections. Only attempt with solid backcountry experience and proper preparation.
        </div>

    <!-- SECTION 3: SEASONAL WEATHER & CONDITIONS -->
    <section id="weather">
        <h2>Seasonal Weather Patterns & Ridge Conditions</h2>

        <h3>Spring (April-May): Muddy & Technical üå∏</h3>
        <p><strong>Temperature:</strong> 40-55¬∞F | <strong>Tick Risk:</strong> Moderate | <strong>Conditions:</strong> Muddy scrambles</p>
        <p>Snowmelt creates treacherous mud. Ridge sections become slippery. Nymph ticks emerging. Spring scrambling dangerous. Not recommended.</p>

        <h3>Summer (June-August): Crowded & Buggy ‚òÄÔ∏è</h3>
        <p><strong>Temperature:</strong> 70-80¬∞F | <strong>Tick Risk:</strong> Extreme | <strong>Crowds:</strong> Significant</p>
        <p>Peak season brings crowds to popular ridge sections. Peak tick season‚Äîscrub habitat extremely risky. Starting before 7am recommended. Summer thunderstorms develop rapidly at ridge elevation.</p>

        <h3>Fall (September-November): Optimal (With Caution) üçÇ</h3>
        <p><strong>Temperature:</strong> 50-70¬∞F | <strong>Tick Risk:</strong> Very High | <strong>Foliage:</strong> Spectacular</p>
        <p>Excellent conditions with clear ridge views. September offers best tick-to-weather ratio. October brings adult ticks. Ridge exposure increases weather volatility.</p>

        <h3>Winter (December-March): Extremely Hazardous ‚ùÑÔ∏è</h3>
        <p><strong>Temperature:</strong> 20-35¬∞F | <strong>Tick Risk:</strong> Low | <strong>Conditions:</strong> Icy exposed ridge</p>
        <p>Ice and snow on exposed ridge creates serious hazard. Wind exposure increases danger. Only experienced winter mountaineers. Not recommended for majority of hikers.</p>

        <div class="warning">
            <strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Ridge Weather Volatility:</strong> Exposure at 2,300 ft elevation creates unpredictable weather. Temperatures 20-30 degrees lower than valley. Winds extreme. Check forecast multiple times day-of before committing.

    <!-- SECTION 4: TICK PREVENTION STRATEGY -->
    <section id="tick-prevention">
        <h2>Taconic Crest Tick Prevention: Extreme Exposure</h2>
        <p>Ridge scrub habitat is prime tick zone. Extended time in open ridgeline increases exposure exponentially. Comprehensive multi-layered prevention non-negotiable.</p>

        <h3>Pre-Hike Preparation</h3>
        <div class="strategy-box">
            <ul>
                <li>FULL permethrin-treated outfit (no compromises)</li>
                <li>Long pants tucked into treated white socks</li>
                <li>Long-sleeve treated shirt + light jacket</li>
                <li>Hat or hood with permethrin treatment</li>
                <li>Heavy-duty work gloves</li>
                <li>Multiple repellent bottles (2+ per person)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>During 5+ Hour Ridge Exposure</h3>
        <p>Reapply picarikin every 1-2 hours. Perform tick checks every 2 hours‚Äîdon't wait until afternoon. Remove ticks immediately if found. Many hikers develop tick anxiety on Taconic; this is NORMAL and appropriate.</p>

        <h3>Post-Hike Protocol</h3>
        <p>Shower immediately upon returning home (do not delay). Perform thorough full-body inspection. Inspect hairline carefully‚Äîridge wind can deposit ticks on scalp. Wash treated clothing separately. Dry on high heat.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Taconic-Specific Reality:</strong> Ridge scrub is extreme tick habitat. Experienced hikers report picking dozens of ticks off during post-hike inspection. This is the norm here, not an anomaly. Proper prevention reduces transmission risk but doesn't eliminate tick encounters.

    <!-- SECTION 6: DETAILED ROUTE GUIDE -->
    <section id="route-details">
        <h2>Detailed Route Guide: Northern Ridge Section</h2>

        <h3>Route Summary: 10 Miles, 5-6 Hours, 1,800ft Elevation Gain</h3>
        <p><strong>Start:</strong> Bash Bish Falls parking area (MA side)</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>0.0-1.5 mi:</strong> Initial climb to ridge (steep, gaining elevation quickly)</li>
            <li><strong>1.5-3.5 mi:</strong> Open ridge section (exposed, extreme tick habitat)</li>
            <li><strong>3.5-5.5 mi:</strong> Sustained ridge walking with views (ups/downs)</li>
            <li><strong>5.5-7.5 mi:</strong> Secondary peak approach (technical footing)</li>
            <li><strong>7.5-10.0 mi:</strong> Descent to southern trailhead option</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Water Availability</h3>
        <p>NO reliable water sources on ridge. Carry minimum 4-5 liters per person. Refill if passing brooks in lower sections. Dehydration risk high on exposed ridge.</p>

        <h3>Tick Reality Check</h3>
        <p>Expect to find ticks during the hike (rare to find none). Peak tick detection occurs around mile 3-5 (open ridgeline). Perform mid-hike tick check at mile 5 turnpoint. Remove found ticks immediately using proper technique.</p>

        <h3>Best Times</h3>
        <p>Early September weekday mornings offer best conditions. Leave at 6am from parking for summit by 11am and return by 2pm. Avoid July-August peak crowds and extreme tick pressure.</p>

    <!-- SECTION 7: SAFETY & EMERGENCY -->
    <section id="safety">
        <h2>Safety on Taconic Crest: Serious Wilderness Precautions</h2>

        <h3>Cell Service</h3>
        <p>Verizon has spotty coverage on ridge. AT&T unreliable. NO service in many sections. Tell someone your planned route and expected return time BEFORE departing.</p>

        <h3>Ridge Hazards</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Exposure:</strong> 2,300 ft elevation with extreme wind</li>
            <li><strong>Weather:</strong> Develops rapidly, lightning risk</li>
            <li><strong>Ticks:</strong> Extreme exposure‚Äîexpect dozens</li>
            <li><strong>Rocks:</strong> Technical footing, ankle injury risk</li>
            <li><strong>Dehydration:</strong> No water sources, intense sun</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>When to Turn Around</h3>
        <p>Abort if: (1) Weather deteriorates, (2) You're exhausted at midpoint, (3) It's past 2pm at peak, (4) Wind becomes dangerous, (5) Lightning threatens. Pride is not worth rescue or death.</p>

        <h3>Nearest Hospital</h3>
        <p><strong>Berkshire Medical Center:</strong> Pittsfield, MA (30 minutes from trailhead). Lyme disease testing available. Inform of tick exposure immediately if symptoms develop.</p>

    <section id="summary">
        <h2>Taconic Crest: Serious Ridge for Serious Hikers</h2>
        <p>Taconic Crest offers genuine alpine experience close to NYC. The ridge's spectacular views come with extreme tick exposure and serious hazards.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Final Recommendation:</strong> Only attempt Taconic Crest if: (1) You have substantial backcountry experience, (2) You're comfortable with dozens of tick encounters, (3) You understand ridge weather unpredictability, (4) You start early and commit to turnaround time. Bring maximum-strength repellent, multiple removal tools, and realistic expectations. Taconic Crest is not casual hiking.
