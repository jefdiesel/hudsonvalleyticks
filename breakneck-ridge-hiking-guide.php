    <!-- SECTION 1: ACCESSIBILITY FROM NYC -->
    <section id="accessibility">
        <h2>Getting to Breakneck Ridge from NYC</h2>
        <p>Breakneck Ridge has the easiest NYC access of any major Hudson Valley hike‚Äîdirect Metro-North connection with minimal walking required.</p>

        <h3>üöÜ Metro-North Railroad (Optimal)</h3>
        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 50-60 minutes | <strong>Cost:</strong> $7-12 one-way | <strong>Convenience:</strong> Walk directly from station</p>
        <p>Grand Central Terminal ‚Üí Cold Spring Station on Hudson Line. Exit station and walk 5 minutes to Breakneck Ridge trailhead. This is the preferred NYC access for serious hikers.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Trains depart every 30-60 minutes on weekdays</li>
            <li>Weekend service: every 45-90 minutes</li>
            <li>Purchase Hudson Line tickets at kiosk</li>
            <li>Return trains available every hour</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>üöó Driving from NYC</h3>
        <p><strong>Distance:</strong> 50 miles | <strong>Drive Time:</strong> 70-90 minutes</p>
        <p>Take Hudson River Parkway north across Tappan Zee Bridge. Continue on Route 9D north toward Cold Spring. Limited parking available at scenic overlook near trailhead ($10-15). Parking fills by 9am on weekends.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Google Maps: "Breakneck Ridge Cold Spring NY"</li>
            <li>Very limited parking (15-20 spaces)</li>
            <li>Consider Metro-North to avoid parking stress</li>
            <li>Overflow parking in Cold Spring village</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Cold Spring Village Stop</h3>
        <p>Cold Spring is charming Hudson Valley town with excellent restaurants and coffee shops. Grab coffee and snacks before or after hiking. Many visitors make this a longer day trip rather than rushing back to NYC.</p>

        <h3>Tick Prevention During Travel</h3>
        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Essential Preparation:</strong> Metro-North riders: Change into FULL permethrin-treated gear at Cold Spring station before walking to trailhead. Driving visitors: Change at parking lot. Breakneck's steep faces concentrate ticks in lower scrub sections‚Äîprotective clothing is non-negotiable despite dramatic cliff exposure.

    <!-- SECTION 2: TRAIL DIFFICULTY & SKILLS -->
    <section id="difficulty">
        <h2>Trail Difficulty & Route Options</h2>
        <p>Breakneck Ridge is Hudson Valley's most challenging hike. Routes range from scrambling chaos to technical rock climbing.</p>

        <h3>Standard Ridge Scramble (3.5 miles, 2-2.5 hours)</h3>
        <p><strong>Challenge Level: Very High</strong></p>
        <p>Direct ascent via steep red-blazed trail with hand-over-hand scrambling, loose rock, and near-vertical sections. Exposure ranges from 20-100+ feet. Requires excellent physical condition, comfort with heights, and scrambling experience. Elevation gain: 1,100 feet in less than 1.5 miles. NOT recommended for beginners.</p>

        <h3>Scenic Loop via Forest Trail (5 miles, 3-3.5 hours)</h3>
        <p><strong>Challenge Level: Moderate</strong></p>
        <p>Avoids the direct scramble by ascending via forest trails then approaching the ridge from above. Less dramatic but still significant. Better for people intimidated by vertical scrambling. Elevation gain: 1,200 feet over longer distance.</p>

        <h3>Detailed Exposure: Breakneck's Reality</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Miles 0-0.75:</strong> 80-degree slopes with 50-100ft exposure</li>
            <li><strong>Miles 0.75-1.3:</strong> Near-vertical hand-over-hand scrambling (most exposed section)</li>
            <li><strong>Miles 1.3+:</strong> Ridge walking with 30-50ft exposure on both sides</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="warning">
            <strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Warning:</strong> Breakneck Ridge is NOT a hiking trail. It's a rock scramble with significant fall risk. 15-20 rescue operations occur annually. People have died here. Only hike if comfortable with exposure, scrambling, and potential danger. This is not hyperbole.
        </div>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 3: SEASONAL WEATHER & CONDITIONS -->
    <section id="weather">
        <h2>Seasonal Weather Patterns & Critical Conditions</h2>

        <h3>Spring (April-May): Dangerous Mud üå∏</h3>
        <p><strong>Temperature:</strong> 45-55¬∞F | <strong>Tick Risk:</strong> Moderate | <strong>Hazard Level:</strong> Very High</p>
        <p>Muddy conditions make near-vertical scrambles extremely dangerous. Loose rock becomes lethal with moisture. Nymph ticks emerge by late April. Avoid spring hiking on Breakneck unless you have advanced scrambling experience and dry conditions.</p>

        <h3>Summer (June-August): Hot, Crowded, Dangerous ‚òÄÔ∏è</h3>
        <p><strong>Temperature:</strong> 80-90¬∞F | <strong>Tick Risk:</strong> Very High | <strong>Hazard Level:</strong> High</p>
        <p>Crowding creates rescue bottlenecks. Weekend crowds of 500+ people create accidents. Peak tick season‚Äînymphs extremely active in scrub habitat. July-August are statistically deadliest months. Start early (6-7am) to avoid crowds and heat.</p>

        <h3>Fall (September-November): Optimal (With Caution) üçÇ</h3>
        <p><strong>Temperature:</strong> 50-70¬∞F | <strong>Tick Risk:</strong> High | <strong>Hazard Level:</strong> Moderate</p>
        <p>Ideal weather and clear views. September offers the best balance of safety and tick pressure. October brings adult ticks. November features fewer hikers and lower tick populations. Dry conditions provide better rock grip than spring mud.</p>

        <h3>Winter (December-March): Extremely Hazardous ‚ùÑÔ∏è</h3>
        <p><strong>Temperature:</strong> 25-40¬∞F | <strong>Tick Risk:</strong> Low | <strong>Hazard Level:</strong> Critical</p>
        <p>Ice-covered rock and frozen exposure are deadly. Winter rescues are complex. Experienced winter mountaineers only. Not recommended for the vast majority of hikers regardless of experience level.</p>

        <div class="warning">
            <strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Weather Volatility:</strong> Breakneck's elevation and ridge position create sudden wind and cloud changes. Visibility can drop from 5 miles to 50 feet in minutes. Check weather.gov before departing. Don't summit if storms approach.
        </div>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 4: TICK PREVENTION STRATEGY -->
    <section id="tick-prevention">
        <h2>Breakneck Ridge Tick Prevention: Despite Dramatic Exposure</h2>
        <p>Breakneck's steep scrambles don't eliminate tick risk. Scrub habitat at base of ridge harbors significant tick populations. Comprehensive prevention is non-negotiable.</p>

        <h3>Pre-Hike Preparation</h3>
        <div class="strategy-box">
            <ul>
                <li>FULL permethrin-treated hiking outfit (no compromises)</li>
                <li>Long pants tucked into white treated socks</li>
                <li>Long-sleeve treated shirt</li>
                <li>Hat or hood (ticks drop from trees onto head)</li>
                <li>Heavy-duty gloves for grip and tick barrier</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>During Scrambling</h3>
        <p>Maintain protective gear despite hot conditions and climbing exertion. The dramatic exposure creates false sense of safety. Ticks don't care about altitude or steepness. Many hikers remove clothing during summer ascents‚Äîthis is dangerous for tick exposure.</p>

        <h3>Post-Hike Protocol</h3>
        <p>Shower immediately (within 1 hour if possible). Inspect entire body focusing on groin, armpits, behind ears, and hairline. Wash treated clothing on high heat separately. Dry on highest setting.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Breakneck's Tick Paradox:</strong> Steep exposure and dramatic cliffs create psychological safety. Hikers dress lightly despite tick risk. Don't be deceived by altitude‚Äîthe most dangerous ticks are in the scrub base sections, not the ridge top. Maintain full protection during entire hike.

    <!-- SECTION 6: DETAILED ROUTE GUIDE -->
    <section id="route-details">
        <h2>Detailed Route: Standard Ridge Scramble (3.5 Miles)</h2>

        <h3>Route Summary: 3.5 Miles, 2-2.5 Hours, 1,100ft Elevation Gain</h3>
        <p><strong>Start:</strong> Cold Spring Train Station or scenic overlook parking</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>0.0-0.2 mi:</strong> Walk from station to Breakneck Trail sign</li>
            <li><strong>0.2-0.8 mi:</strong> Steep ascent with hand scrambling (50-80ft exposure)</li>
            <li><strong>0.8-1.3 mi:</strong> Most exposed section with near-vertical climbing (100ft+ exposure in places)</li>
            <li><strong>1.3-2.5 mi:</strong> Ridge walking with dramatic Hudson River views (30-50ft exposure)</li>
            <li><strong>2.5-3.5 mi:</strong> Descent via red-blazed trail (loose rock, technical footing)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Key Waypoints & Hazard Areas</h3>
        <p><strong>The Chimney (Mile 0.8-1.0):</strong> Most dangerous section. 40-foot near-vertical scramble with minimal rock quality. Hand and foot placement critical. Downclimbing here is EXTREMELY hazardous. Many accidents occur here.</p>
        <p><strong>Ridge Top (Mile 1.5-2.0):</strong> Spectacular 360-degree views but exposure on both sides. Wind can be strong. Don't get distracted by views‚Äîstay focused on footing.</p>

        <h3>Crowding & Safety Considerations</h3>
        <p><strong>Critical:</strong> Breakneck fills with 500+ weekend hikers in summer. Crowding creates serious bottlenecks on narrow sections. People step on others' heads during scrambles. Start by 7am to beat crowds or go on weekdays when feasible.</p>

        <h3>Turn-Around Decision</h3>
        <p>Consider turning around at "viewpoint" sections if uncomfortable with exposure, scrambling difficulty, or crowding. The ridge doesn't get better as you progress‚Äîif you're not enjoying the scramble, it's okay to descend.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 7: SAFETY & EMERGENCY -->
    <section id="safety">
        <h2>Critical Safety Considerations & Emergency Information</h2>

        <h3>Annual Rescues & Deaths</h3>
        <p>Breakneck Ridge averages 15-20 rescue operations annually. People have died here. Average age of rescue cases is 35‚Äînot just beginners. Respect this mountain.</p>

        <h3>Hazards & Mitigation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Exposure:</strong> 20-100ft drops with minimal protection. One misstep = death</li>
            <li><strong>Loose rock:</strong> Rock quality is poor. Handhold or foothold failure common</li>
            <li><strong>Ticks:</strong> Scrub habitat supports significant populations</li>
            <li><strong>Crowds:</strong> Weekend crowding creates dangerous bottlenecks</li>
            <li><strong>Weather:</strong> Rapid changes create poor visibility and icy conditions</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Cell Service</h3>
        <p>Verizon coverage generally good at ridge. AT&T spotty in valleys. Always tell someone your planned route and expected return time. Text someone when you summit.</p>

        <h3>Nearest Hospital</h3>
        <p><strong>NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital at Hudson Valley:</strong> Philipstown (15 minutes from trailhead). Excellent trauma center. Lyme disease testing available.</p>

        <h3>When to Abort</h3>
        <p>Turn around if: (1) Weather deteriorates, (2) You become uncomfortable with exposure or scrambling, (3) Crowds prevent safe passage, (4) You're exhausted or dehydrated, (5) It's past 2pm without summit. Pride is not worth rescue or death.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 8: SUMMARY -->
    <section id="summary">
        <h2>Breakneck Ridge: The Serious Hiker's Challenge</h2>
        <p>Breakneck Ridge is Hudson Valley's most demanding hike‚Äîsteep scrambles, dramatic exposure, and serious hazards. It's not a recreational nature walk. It's a genuine mountaineering objective that commands respect.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Final Recommendation:</strong> Only attempt Breakneck Ridge if: (1) You have scrambling experience, (2) You're comfortable with 100ft+ exposure, (3) You understand the inherent danger and accept it, (4) Weather is clear and stable, (5) You start early to beat crowds. Don't let Instagram photos and hype pressure you into attempting this objective unprepared. Many excellent Hudson Valley hikes offer spectacular views without death risk. Respect Breakneck. Many don't come back.
